2003/12/28 06:32 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: Implement Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Expose::region.

	* xs/GdkGC.xs: Implement set_clip_region.

	* gtk2perl.h
	* maps
	* xs/GdkRegion.xs: Initial implementation.  Register a custom
	GBoxed GType for GdkRegion.

	* gdk.typemap
	* gtk2perl.h
	* xs/GdkTypes.xs: Extend the GdkGeometry handling.  In addition to
	the accessor based approach, geometries can now also be
	created/changed/accessed as hash references.  Change
	constrain_size to make the flags argument optional.

	* gdk.typemap
	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: Implement new, which required implementing
	GdkWindowAttr handling.  Implement set_user_data; one should still
	use object though.  Implement shape_combine_region,
	set_child_shapes, merge_child_shapes, set_static_gravities,
	is_visible, begin_paint_region, get_frame_extents, get_parent,
	get_children, peek_children, set_icon_list, set_icon,
	get_decorations, get_toplevels, invalidate_region,
	invalidate_maybe_recurse, get_update_area, and
	get_internal_paint_info.

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs
	* xs/GtkWindow.xs: Change set_geometry_hints so that the mask
	argument is optional.

2003/12/28 00:58 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* xs/GtkContainer.xs: Implement propagate_expose.

	* xs/GtkFrame.xs: Use gchar_ornull instead of custom code to check
	for undef in new and set_label.

	* xs/GtkImageMenuItem.xs: In new_from_stock, provide a default for
	the accel_group argument so it can be omitted.

	* xs/GtkMenuItem.xs: Add two FIXME's.  Enable
	gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path -- it's a convenience wrapper around
	gtk_widget_set_accel_path.

	* xs/GtkRadioButton.xs
	* xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs: Check for NULL-ness before using SvOK.

2003/12/23 11:10 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* examples/adding_stock_icons.pl: an example of adding your own stock
	id/icons.

2003/12/18 12:56 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implementation of some functions that weren't before
	for various reasons.

	* t/01.GtkWidget.t: phase two of widget testing, will probably break for 
	some, but that's the price we must pay for thorough testing. there's 46
	tests here, there will be well over 100 before it's done

	* t/accel-group-map.t: test out some of widget's stuff that we need
	accel stuff for.

2003/12/18 12:56 (-0500) muppetman

	* gtk2perl.h: previous change #undef'd the wrong symbols, resulted in
	"macro redefined" warnings all over the place.  bad muppet, no biscuit.

2003/12/18 00:15 (-0500) muppetman

	* gtk2perl.h, maps: in versions prior to 2.3.0, GtkTreeSearchFlags was
	declared such that glib-mkenums interpreted and registered it as a
	GEnum type.  sometime before 2.3.0, this was corrected, and the type
	is registered as a GFlags.  Correct the maps file to declare this as
	GFlags (since that's correct), and mangle things with macro tricks to
	get things to work correctly with older libraries.

	* t/00.Gtk2.t: immediately after init, events_pending returns 0 on
	2.0.x and 2.2.x, but insists on returning 1 on my system.  marked
	that test as TODO for >= 2.3.0 until we figure out what's up.

2003/12/17 22:49 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkLabel.xs: use _ornull on get_mnemonic_widget to avoid warnings
	on 2.0.x.  it's perplexing that this didn't generate warnings on 2.2.4.
	also flesh out get_attributes to allow proper NULL return.

	* t/05.GtkListStore-etc.t: clarifying commentary, reminding us to remove
	the special case if the workaround for $liststore->remove changes.

2003/12/17 21:54 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/05.GtkListStore-etc.t: bad bugs fixed, skips were needed, and stuff
	like that.

2003/12/16 22:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkTypes.xs, xs/GdkWindow.xs, xs/GtkHScrollbar.xs, xs/GtkPaned.xs,
	xs/GtkRc.xs, xs/GtkTreeModel.xs, xs/GtkVScrollbar.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs,
	xs/GtkWindow.xs: warnings fixes.

2003/12/16 21:56 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/06.GtkLabel.t, t/08.GtkCombo.t: more complete testing

	* t/05.GtkListStore-etc.t: added complete comment

	* t/accel-group-map.t: added a version check to the skip, since it will
	be fixed by 2.4.x

	* xs/GtkListItem.xs: added an alias for new_with_label

	* xs/GtkListStore.xs: added an alias for set_value

2003/12/16 04:36 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/05.GtkListStore-etc.t: complete GtkListStore api testing.

2003/12/16 13:16 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: use the new BLIB_MOD_EXISTS var in place of pure_all

2003/12/16 09:23 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: \ should of been \\, caused a hang on perl with no 
	script name.

2003/12/15 23:11 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkList.xs: checks on non-null list should of been list_items, 
	minor bug, but a bug nontheless.

2003/12/15 20:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: added pure_all as a dep on a few things

2003/12/15 13:44 (-0500) muppetman

	* t/22.GtkListStore.t, t/23.GtkTreeStore.t: on GTK+ 2.0.x, gtk_main()
	and friends appear to assume that gtk_init() has been called.  a plain
	GMainLoop would not do this, but these tests actually have no need for
	the main loop + idle hack in the first place.  also correct the skip
	count.

2003/12/15 13:25 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs, AUTHORS: patch from Roderich Schupp implements
	a custom marshaler for the rows-reordered signal.  applied with small
	changes.

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: implement the old FIXMEd rows_reordered method.

	* xs/GtkTreeStore.xs: off-by-one error in reorder().  changed loop
	logic to be a little clearer at the expense of an extra iterator var.

	* t/22.GtkListStore.t, t/23.GtkTreeStore.t: add code to test the
	rows-reordered signal and rows_reordered method.  also removed the
	init_check guards on these two, because they don't need a display
	to run their tests.

2003/12/14 17:16 (-0500) muppetman

	* t/paned.t: wait for size-allocate instead of using timeouts... still
	trying to get this test to be robust.

2003/12/14 20:12 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: Fix a slight glitch in the API doc of
	gtk_tree_model_get.

2003/12/12 11:39 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: alias values in get_flags got changed, but the
	switches on ix were not updated, leading to bugs whenever apps tried
	to read or write flag values.  fixed.  renamed get_flags to
	flags_handler (it's hidden from API docs), and created a new xsub
	named flags (aliased to get_flags) as a binding for GTK_WIDGET_FLAGS.

	A t/01.GtkWidget.t
	* MANIFEST: new test, an attempt to catch future flags regressions.

2003/12/11 18:01 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* tools/podifystockitems.pl: was doing Gtk2 '-init' no reason to and it
	caused build (of doc) to fail when no display is set.

2003/12/11 16:53 (-0500) muppetman

	* t/27.GtkClipboard.t, t/30.GtkCellRenderer.t, t/text-iter-searches.t:
	these didn't skip all tests when there is no display, making builds
	fail on headless build servers.  it would be nice to wrap up some of
	this testing boilerplate a bit more.

2003/12/08 13:47 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/paned.t: use strict and use warnings

	* xs/GtkLabel.xs, xs/GtkSizeGroup.xs, xs/GtkStock.xs: apidoc, added 
	enum(s)

2003/12/08 11:14 (-0500) muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: call signature comments to make maintenance easier.

	* t/paned.t: give effect to statement with no effect

2003/12/08 02:39 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implement gtk_widget_style_get for >= 2.2.0

	* t/paned.t: more robust testing

2003/12/07 22:34 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/trivial-widgets.t: initial import

 	* MANIFEST: added t/trivial-widgets.t, and xs/GtkAccelMap.xs

 	* xs/GtkArrow.xs: doc the GtkArrowtype and GtkShadowType enums in pod
 
	* xs/GtkDnd.xs, xs/GtkTreeStore.xs, xs/GtkTreeView.xs: removed a xxx1 
	param

2003/12/07 21:44 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkPaned.xs: turn the child[12]_(resize|shrink) accessors into
	mutators, with doc; rearrange the xsubs to make more sense, and adapt
	the docs from the C api reference for the description section.

	A t/paned.t
	* MANIFEST: new test

2003/12/07 16:19 (-0500) rwmcfa1

 	* xs/GtkCalendar.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs, xs/GtkTreeModel.xs,
	xs/GtkWidget.xs, xs/PangoTabs.xs: apidoc added/fixed.

2003/12/07 16:19 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: DELETE fixed, SPLICE implemented for simplelist.

	* t/19.SimpleList.t: test all of the splice stuff

	* examples/simplelist.pl: (muppet) test the new splice stuff

2003/12/06 01:30 (-0500) rwmcfa1

 	* xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs: Gtk2-> functions moved under Gtk2::AccellGroups
	which seems to make more sense.

 	* xs/GtkAccelMap.xs: intial import, 3/4 complete.
 
 	* t/accel-group-map.t: test out the new AccelMap stuff, in conjunction
 	with AccelGroup. 

	* xs_files-2.0: added xs/GtkAccelMap.xs

2003/12/05 13:42 (-0500) muppetman

	move the not-to-be-installed helper scripts to a subdirectory to
	reduce clutter.

	A tools/podifyenums.pl
	* Makefile.PL: add tool and use it to generate a single pod file
	listing the values of all the enum and flags types listed in the
	maps file, installed as Gtk2::enums(3pm).

	* MANIFEST: updated to reflect all that movement.

2003/12/05 12:53 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/accel-group-map.t: updated and more complete

	* xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs: added a synopsis mainly showing that 
	Gtk2::Window::add_accel_group is normally used. moved activate and
	groups_from_object to the Gtk2 namespace and added class params for
	them.

2003/12/05 07:49 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/accel-group-map.t: initial import of accel group and accel map test
	accel has some issues, way more to come, and resolution of those as 
	well.

2003/12/04 23:23 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* t/calendar.t: initial import

2003/12/04 21:35 (-0500) muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version to 1.030 for next unstable devel series.
	sync authors section with the AUTHORS file.

	* AUTHORS: remove circular file reference and point readers to the
	LICENSE file rather than including more boilerplate than content.

2003/12/04 13:10 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: moved the --disable-apidoc thing to MakeHelper.pm, that
	way everyone can use it.

2003/12/04 09:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* fetch_faq.pl, MANIFEST: initial import for fetch_faq.pl, needs 
	testing

	* Makefile.PL: --enable-faq and --disable-apidoc added and worked out

2003/12/04 00:51 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* : Merge of rel-1-02 doc and fixes back. (following 3 apply)

	* xs/(bunch).xs: ... (list) comments corrected

	* xs/GtkTreeDnd.xs: ^ and fixed bug in api of 
	gtk_tree_drag_source_drag_data_get, selection_data is an out param.

	* xs/(bunch).xs: s/=(arg|signature)/=for $1/

2003/12/02 13:58 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* : Merge of rel-1-02 doc and fixes back. (following 2 apply)

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs, xs/GdkPixmap.xs, xs/GtkObject.xs: doc

	* xs/GdkDnd.xs xs/GdkProperty.xs, xs/GtkClipboard.xs, xs/GtkDnd.xs,
	xs/GtkListStore.xs, xs/GtkSelection.xs, xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs,
	xs/GtkTreeDnd.xs, xs/GtkTreeStore.xs, xs/GtkTreeView.xs,
	xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: api doc additions.

2003/11/29 16:51 (-0500) muppetman

	* t/ignore_keyboard.pl: merge test helper script from head
	* Gtk2.pm, README: bump to 1.013
	* Makefile.PL: require Glib 1.013

2003/11/29 12:21 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkMessageDialog.xs: gtk_message_dialog_new uses printf-like
	semantics and does not offer a safe literal version.  pass the message
	through "%s" to be safe, and allow Gtk2::MessageDialog->new to take
	printf-like arguments to be nice.

2003/11/29 12:14 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* MANIFEST: missing files added

	* t/ignore_keyboard.pl: initial import

	* t/*.t: use the new ignore_keyboard.pl stuff so that tests won't fail
	if you accidentally type while they're going on.

2003/11/29 11:23 (-0500) muppetman

	* MANIFEST
	A examples/inline-images.pl: new example

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: lots of pod for various hard-to-use functions.
	removed unnecessary length() parameter from new_from_inline(), which
	will break any code that was using it, but it's really hard to use
	as it is so i can't imagine anyone's using it.  if you are, i
	apologize.

2003/11/28 21:57 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkRc.xs: SV * class isn't needed

2003/11/28 14:54 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: DOC_PL_DEPENDS -> POD_DEPENDS

2003/11/28 12:44 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2.pm: fixed bug in cleanpath code, spotty by kaffee
 
	* Makefile.PL: when running podifystockitems.pl include blib path for 
	Gtk2, it may not be installed yet.
	
	* xs/Gdk.xs: doc ^ and gdk_threads -> gdk_threads_init

	* xs/GdkColor.xs, xs/GdkDnd.xs, xs/GdkDrawable.xs, xs/GdkGC.xs,
	xs/GdkProperty.xs, xs/GdkSelection.xs, xs/GtkColorSelection.xs,
	xs/GtkCombo.xs, xs/GtkContainer.xs, xs/GtkCurve.xs,

	xs/PangoLayout.xs, xs/PangoTabs.xs: doc updates, including ALIAS'es 
	starting at 0 where appropriate.

2003/11/25 11:46 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* podifystockitems.pl: initial import

	* Gtk2.pm, xs/GtkButton.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs, xs/GtkWindow.xs: link 
	corrections

	* Makefile.PL: use new DOC_PL_DEPENDS var, added rule for building 
	stock_items.podi

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: cause Gtk2::Separator and Gtk2::Scrollbar to have pages

	* xs/GtkStock.xs: use new include system to put list of stock items in 
	pod

2003/11/24 11:27 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkCombo.xs, xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs,
	xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs, xs/GtkWindow.xs: doc updates

2003/11/24 11:27 (-0500) muppetman

	* MANIFEST: added GdkKeys.xs

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs: nearly doubled the size of the file with api 
	documentation, mostly copied or adapted from the C api reference.
	re-ordered some of the xsubs to make more sense in the doc, but
	changed no code.

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: added some 2.2.x methods that got omitted by
	accident: get_root_window, get_screen, and has_screen.

2003/11/23 20:01 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkKeys.xs: initial import, implements Gtk2::Gdk::Keymap and 
	Gtk2::Gdk::Keyval functions. some need Gtk2::Gdk::KeymapKey typemap.

	* xs_files-2.0: added ^

2003/11/21 10:43 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkWindow.xs: add some enums to Gtk2::Window's doc.

2003/11/21 02:16 (-0500) muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, Makefile.PL: update requirements to Glib 1.012,
	and bump version for 1.012 beta release.

	xs/GtkTextIter.xs, xs/GtkTextTag.xs, xs/GtkTreeModel.xs,
	xs/PangoTabs.xs: remove copy methods in favor of Glib::Boxed::copy.

2003/11/21 01:09 (-0500) muppetman

	* CodeGen.pm, gtk2perl.h, xs/GdkGC.xs, xs/GdkPixbuf.xs,
	xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, xs/GtkItemFactory.xs, xs/GtkNotebook.xs,
	xs/GtkSelection.xs, xs/GtkTooltips.xs, xs/GtkTreeSortable.xs:
	use SvOK() as a lighter test for definedness than SvTRUE().
	generally just try to make these tests cheaper.

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: rearrange iter_next() to avoid leaking the
	iter copy when there is no next node.

2003/11/20 19:43 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: some of it, V should be in there even on win32.

	* xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: ..._factory_new, allow accel_group to default,
	Torsten Schoenfeld

	* Gtk2.pm: patch applied to improve the cleanpath stuff.

2003/11/19 14:14 (-0500) muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: don't do the install stuff on win32, it b0rks things.

	* Gtk2.exports: newSVGdkModifierType isn't a function anymore.

	* xs/GtkEditable.xs, xs/GtkMenu.xs: apparently cl.exe (MSVC's compiler)
	doesn't like the version of dSP used in PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT to occur
	after code has started; move dGPERL_CLOSURE_MARSHAL_ARGS to the end of
	the variable declarations block to make it happy.  (the last statement
	in that macro is dSP.)  continue to loathe msvc.

2003/11/19 11:14 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkRc.xs: finally committing stuff i did for GtkRcStyle a looong
	time ago.  accessors and mutators for various members of GtkRcStyle,
	and some methods that were commented out in GtkRc.xs.  not commonly
	needed, but handy in rare situations.

2003/11/19 09:10 (-0500) rwmcfa1
	
	* t/22.GtkListStore.t: there was a skip unless 2.2.x in which the iter 
	was converted to a string, that iter is no longer the inc'd one and thus
	was 0 instead of 1. follow up to last commit.

2003/11/18 17:21 (-0500) muppetman

	* t/file-selection.t: new test

	* t/22.GtkListStore.t: fix GtkListStore test to expect new iter->next
	semantics.

	* xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: gtk_file_selection_get_filename returns a
	statically allocated string -- use GPerlFilename_const instead of
	GPerlFilename_own to avoid core dumps.

	* xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: use GPerlFilename_const to hush compiler
	warnings.  

2003/11/18 09:42 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: $model->iter_next fixed, we needed to make a copy
	of the iter, otherwise we were modifying the passed one (which isn't 
	very perly) and then returning it.

2003/11/18 01:16 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkEntry.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs, xs/PangoLayout.xs: now that we
	have typemaps for gunichar, implement things that were waiting on it.

	* xs/PangoLayout.xs: convert a few things to use gchar_length and 
	length(); don't make pango call strlen() when perl already knows the
	text's length!

	* t/text-iter-searches.t: new test for the GtkTextIter search tools.
	this one isn't numbered because it just needs to run after all of
	the numbered tests.

2003/11/17 23:21 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkDisplayManager.xs, xs/GdkDnd.xs, xs/GdkPixmap.xs, 
	xs/GdkProperty.xs, xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/GdkTypes.xs, xs/GdkWindow.xs, 
	xs/Gtk2.xs, xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs, xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, 
	xs/GtkColorSelection.xs, xs/GtkCurve.xs, xs/GtkEditable.xs, 
	xs/GtkFileSelection.xs, xs/GtkIconFactory.xs, xs/GtkLabel.xs, 
	xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs, xs/GtkSelection.xs, xs/GtkStock.xs, 
	xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkTreeModel.xs, xs/GtkTreeSortable.xs, 
	xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs, xs/PangoLayout.xs, xs/PangoTabs.xs: apidoc 
	added, almost all PPCODE xsubs now have it

	* xs/GtkTreeDnd.xs: gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data had the outlist params 
	in the prototype. apidoc added, almost all PPCODE xsubs now have it

	* xs/GtkContainer.xs: PPCODE -> CODE, return was always void. apidoc 
	added, almost all PPCODE xsubs now have it

	* xs/GdkSelection.xs: added a class parameter to 
	gdk_selection_property_get. apidoc added, almost all PPCODE xsubs now 
	have it

2003/11/17 16:27 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: i borked the get_from_(drawable|image) xsubs...
	this fixes them, and adds docs.

2003/11/17 22:04 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* CodeGen.pm: Create INPUT typemaps for the 'const' equivalents of
	GBoxed's, too.

2003/11/17 12:51 (-0500) muppetman

	* TODO: updated

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: added key snoopers and docs for Gtk2->init.

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: more missing methods, get_from_drawable and
	get_from_image.  looks like these were missing because of bugs
	in genfirstpass a long time ago.

	* xs/GdkDrawable.xs: wrong PREFIX resulted in wrong method name for
	gdk_drawable_get_image().  bug report from dosmodi gergely.

2003/11/17 07:10 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: xs_files-2.3 shouldn't be involved outside of the 2.3 
	branch. problem found by Bjarne Steinsbø

2003/11/16 21:36 (-0500) rwmcfa1

	* ChangeLog, xs/GdkDisplay.xs, xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, xs/GtkImage.xs,
	xs/GtkRadioButton.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs, xs/GtkTooltips.xs,
	xs/GtkTreeView.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs, xs/GtkWindow.xs, xs/PangoFont.xs:
	apidoc updates

2003/11/16 20:32 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkMenu.xs: use the new GPerlCallback helper macros in
	gperl_marshal.h

2003/11/16 02:44 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, xs/GtkEditable.xs, xs/GtkMenu.xs:
	clean up the stack properly after call_sv to stop internal bleeding.

2003/11/13 23:41 (-0500) muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, Makefile.PL, README: bump version to 1.011

2003/11/14 04:06 pcg

	* xs/GdkTypes.xs: fix constrain_size name.

2003/11/13 21:26 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs: genfirstpass appears to have
	skipped shape_combine_mask all those months ago.  implemented it in
	both GdkWindow and GtkWidget because i like cool shaped windows.

2003/11/13 13:25 (-0500) muppetman

	* gdk.typemap: hush compiler warning 'incompatible type for arg 1 of
	Perl_croak_nocontext' -- croak() is by default croak_nocontext, which
	does not get aTHX_ passed to it.

	* xs/GdkTypes.xs: typo in constrain_size -- no such function as
	mewSViv, although the name is nice.  :)
	add pod for the rectangle mutators, so their signatures make sense
	in the docs.

2003/11/12 18:28 pcg

	* gdk.typemap, xs/GdkTypes.xs: implement Gtk2::Gdk::Geometry.
        * xs/GdkWindow.xs, xs/GtkWindow.xs: use it and move
        gdk_window_constraing_size to GdkTypes.xs.

2003/11/12 16:05 pcg

	* xs/GdkTypes.xs: change acessor methods to mutators for
        Gtk2::Gdk:Rectangle.

2003/11/11 23:00 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/PangoFont.xs: put the docs for the constants into the
	Gtk2::Pango::FontDescription package, so that the doc generation
	stuff doesn't overwrite the docs from Pango.pm.

2003/11/12 01:57 pcg

        * xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, xs/GtkWindow.xs, xs/GtkImage.xs, xs/GtkRc.xs,
        xs/GtkIconFactory.xs, xs/GdkPixmap.xs: use GPerlFilename and
        gperl_filename_from_sv on behalf of the user, so filenames work
        the same as in other parts of gtk/glib (and sometimes unlike perl,
        but it's the only way to load locale-encoded files).
        * xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: convert to use new typemap entries.

2003/11/11 00:36 (-0500) muppetman

	* MANIFEST, debian/*: remove the debian packaging files, since having
	them in the upstream dist makes it difficult for the maintainers

	* xs/GtkEditable.xs: use casts to hush the compiler's indignant warnings
	about our flagrant disregard for the const-ness of param_values

	* xs/PangoContext.xs: remove a couple of functions that are only enabled
	when building pango backends

2003/11/10 15:00 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: bind gtk_widget_event().

	* examples/rulers.pl, MANIFEST: add a ported version of the rulers
	example from the gtk-perl tutorial, using gtk_widget_event() to 
	propagate the motion notify events to the rulers.  this was previously
	not possible.

2003/11/10 13:35 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs, xs/GtkEditable.xs: use the new macros in the new
	gperl_marshal.h to implement custom signal marshallers.

	* examples/insert-text-test.pl: additional marshaller smoke test

2003/11/10 09:12 (-0500) rwmcfa1
	
	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: missing ; on the end of function call caused
	syntax error, with somewhat odd message, resolved.

2003/11/10 01:44 (-0500) muppetman

	* api.pod, xs/GdkColor.xs, xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, xs/GtkStyle.xs,
	xs/GtkWidget.xs, xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: move descriptions of
	changed call signatures or semantics from api.pod to apidoc pod
	in the actual xs files.  this isn't all of it, but almost.

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: shuffle the code for get_selected_rows
	and count_selected_rows to avoid them showing up twice in the pod.
 
	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs, xs/GtkTreeView.xs: use the C name in the
	=for enums line --- let GenPod figure out the perl name.

2003/11/09 23:48 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: get_value and get were implemented separately,
	for no good reason; get_value is now an alias for get.  added apidoc
	pods to document the stuff that isn't obvious or is different from
	the C api.

	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs: switch widget_to_tree_coords and
	tree_to_widget_coords to use OUTLIST to save code and avoid the need
	to add a =for signature line.  add apidoc pod for other stuff.

	* api.pod: removed stuff from the specifics section that is now
	documented directly in the apidoc pods.

2003/11/10 01:51 pcg

	* api.pod: Document new operation on GFlags.

2003/11/08 01:20 (-0500) muppetman

	* examples/cellrenderer_date.pl, examples/cellrenderer_popup.pl,
	examples/cellrenderer_spinbutton.pl, examples/histogramplot.pl:
	update to use new fangled flags operators

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs: fix the same sorts of bugs in the dialog::response
	marshaller as we found earlier this week in Glib/GClosure.xs.

	A examples/insert-text-test.pl
	* xs/GtkEditable.xs: fix the Gtk2::Editable::insert-text signal.
	allows you to modify the arguments or return values on the stack,
	by the TIMTOWTDI principle.  new example code modifies @_.

2003/11/07 21:09 pcg

	* gtk2perl.h: removed newSVGdkModifierType hack.

2003/11/07 16:49 pcg

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: implement gdk_window_set_debug_updates.
        * MANIFEST: Add xs_files*.

2003/11/07 11:53 (+0100) kaffeetisch

	* xs/GtkClipboard.xs: Two other places where PERL_UNUSED_VAR was called
	before variables are declared.  Fix necessary to make it compile on
	FreeBSD.

2003/11/06 16:53 (-0500) muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: link to the generated pods.

2003/11/06 10:30 (-0500) muppetman

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: handle logs for GdkPixbuf, too.

2003/11/06 13:48 kaffeetisch

	* xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: Call dSP before PERL_UNUSED_VAR to make it
	compile on FreeBSD.

2003/11/03 14:05 muppetman

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: GenPod uses instance arg names now, so we can
	remove all the ugly signature overrides.

2003/11/03 18:37 pcg

	* Makefile.PL: avoid "package MY" for easier access to variables.
	* MANIFEST: ScrollBar => Scrollbar.
        * api.pod: Document Scorll[bB] change.

2003/11/03 12:18 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: @lists needs to be our, not my.  updated some comments.

	* t/00.Gtk2.t: scalar versus list context bug in version info test

	* AUTHORS: added bjarne to the contributors list

2003/11/03 16:24 pcg

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: Implement a bunch of minor methods, some of them
        even tested.

2003/11/03 12:45 muppetman

	A xs_files-2.0: new file listing source files for gtk+-2.0.x
	A xs_files-2.2: new file listing source files for gtk+-2.2.x
	* CodeGen.pm, Makefile.PL: modify build to use explicit lists of
	source code files based on the discovered gtk+ version, rather
	than just globbing all the files the xs dir.

	D xs/GtkHScrollBar.xs
	A xs/GtkHScrollbar.xs
	D xs/GtkVScrollBar.xs
	A xs/GtkVScrollbar.xs
	long ago, in the early days of gtk2-perl-xs, these files were
	created with the wrong capitalization of the file and package
	names; register.xsh registers Gtk2::[VH]Scrollbar, but the
	files implement Gtk2::[VH]ScrollBar.  since this is wrong, i have
	corrected it by changing the package names and renaming the files,
	but in order to retain compatibility with Gtk2-1.00, the old
	Gtk2::[VH]ScrollBar::new()s are aliased to the new ones. 

2003/11/02 23:26 pcg

        * xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, api.pod: Implement and document
        gdk_pixbuf_render_pixmap_and_mask* functions.

2003/11/02 13:24 pcg

	* api.pod: Document Scrollbar vs. ScrollBar inconsistency.

2003/11/02 16:17 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: undo my silly "atleast" version checks, and so something
	more like what Exporter would do.  we don't use Exporter directly
	because we're not an exporter, and we still need to watch for -init.

	* Makefile.PL: Glib doesn't use the "atleast" check anymore, either.

2003/11/02 02:12 muppetman

	* xs/GtkButton.xs: after fixing the GenPod bug, it became apparent
	that button's doc needed to hide label on new_with_mnemonic, too.
	while i was at it, fleshed out the description of mnemonics to make
	more sense to people who've never heard of them.

2003/11/01 14:52 rwmcfa1

	* xs/Button.xs: autopod doc added

2003/10/30 22:10 rwmcfa1

	* t/30.GtkCellRenderer.t: this test seems kinda flaky, it was counting 
	that 24 callbacks happened, but often that number seems inconsistent. 
	slight modifications made so that we now check that at least one, edit, 
	render, size, and init happen. activate doesn't seem to ever occur.

2003/10/29 12:40 muppetman

	fixing a few things while tracking down bugs reported by
	Bjarne Steinsbø:

	* xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, xs/GtkStyle.xs: all of the gtk_paint_foo()
	functions ask for GdkWindows, but actually work on GdkDrawables.
	according to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=102678 ,
	the same is true for gtk_cell_renderer_render(), and has been fixed
	in gtk+ 2.3.0.  so, we use GdkDrawable instead of GdkWindow in all
	of those places.

	* examples/cellrenderer_popup.pl: if the treeview is reorderable,
	the popup and editing interaction is broken, resulting in the treeview
	thinking we're still dragging the row.  fix that by using a dummy
	GtkCellEditable.

	* xs/GtkEntry.xs: GtkEntry also implements GtkCellEditable.
	use gperl_prepend_isa() instead of custom AV-handling code.

2003/10/29 09:36 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: improved error messages in get/set_flags. croak when
	trying to set a read only flag.

2003/10/29 02:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: add a version check to Gtk2's import

	* Makefile.PL: use Glib's new 'atleast' version check

2003/10/28 23:21 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: use the new semantics for Glib::MakeHelper methods.
	never just 'use' a non-standard dependency module, place those
	use lines in the eval'd string.  otherwise, the Makefile.PL won't
	pass the compile phase, and CPAN won't pick up dependencies 
	properly.

2003/10/28 16:47 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/MANIFEST: missing files added

	* Gtk2/Makefile.PL: updates to new system, MakeHelper. use strict and 
	use warnings safe now

	* Gtk2/xs/Gtk2.xs: put things in an appropriate doc object

2003/10/27 19:38 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: documentation generation experimentation

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: apidoc pod bundles all of the event subtypes into
	GdkEvent's docs; which creates another problem, namely, they all have
	the same instance name in their call signatures.  so, add =signature
	pods to give them better names.  implemented a few of the more
	esoteric members, too.
	
	* xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs: document CellRendererState and
	CellRendererMode with CellRenderer.

2003/10/27 14:34 muppetman

	* xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs: merged the cellrenderer subclassing stuff,
	with lots of new-style experimental documentation.

	* t/30.GtkCellRenderer.t: new test

	* examples/cellrenderer_date.pl, examples/cellrenderer_popup.pl,
	examples/cellrenderer_spinbutton.pl: new examples

2003/10/22 13:31 muppetman

	stuff found while writing a documentation generator...

	* xs/GtkListStore.xs: stray semicolon
	* xs/GdkScreen.xs: arg list had an output parameter in it

2003/10/19 18:55 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: two missing semicolons added, in 2.2 section so 
	wasn't caught compling on < 2.2.

2003/10/19 00:41 muppetman

	* examples/simplelist.pl, examples/scribble.pl,
	examples/histogramplot.pl: commentary cleanup and such

2003/10/18 02:41 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version for devel series.
	* Makefile.PL: require Glib 1.01 (to pick up a new typemap)

	Made a pass through the source killing FIXMEs.
	* TODO: updated.
	* gtk.typemap, xs/GtkColorSelection.xs, xs/GtkTreeView.xs, 
	xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: cleaned up
	* xs/Gdk.xs, xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkTextTag.xs: use the new
	gchar_ornull typemap to clean things up
	* xs/GdkGC.xs: implemented GdkGCValues stuff, mostly by porting
	Gtk-Perl code.
	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, api.pod: implemented the animation iter and
	pixbuf formats stuff, finally.
	* xs/GtkStyle.xs: painstakingly traced through the source of
	gtkstyle.c to see where NULL is and isn't allowed, and updated all
	the paint_foo functions accordingly.
	* xs/GtkTextIter.xs: implemented get_marks, get_toggled_tags,
	get_attributes, and get_language
	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implement get_child_requisition.  apparently this
	isn't equivalent to get_size_request after all; some widget
	implementations need this (e.g., placing popups by hand).
	* xs/PangoContext.xs: don't know why these weren't implemented.

2003/10/12 13:42 rwmcfa1

	* xs/(most).xs: UNUSED is no more, PERL_UNUSED_VAR used where 
	needed, relies on new ParseXS to prevent the other warnings that were
	its fault, we now only quite the ones that are ours

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkObject.xs: fixed problem where g_object_unref was being
	called on the wrong thing. there was both a SV * class and GtkObject 
	class, no longer the case

======== 1.0

2003/10/10 00:13 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, META.yml, debian/changelog: 1.00

2003/10/03 16:13 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, META.yml, debian/changelog: 1.00rc4

2003/10/03 15:19 muppetman

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs, api.pod: implemented new_from_data.  it doesn't take
	a destroy notify function, as that's automatic.

2003/10/03 13:27 muppetman

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: some of the event functions return new events that
	are owned by the calling code.  use _own and _own_ornull variants as
	necessary to prevent memory leaks.

2003/10/03 13:19 muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm, t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: argument checks in the new
	and new_from_treeview constructors.  new_from_treeview no longer
	allows you to pass undef for the treeview, new creates one.

2003/10/01 11:20 rwmcfa1

	* Glib/GBoxed.xs, Glib/GLog.xs, Glib/GObject.xs, Glib/GSignal.xs,
        Glib/GType.xs, Glib/gperl.h, Gtk2/xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs,
        Gtk2/xs/GtkIconFactory.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs,
        Gtk2/xs/GtkObject.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs,
        Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: // comments -> /*

2003/09/30 20:19 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: fixed bugs with push and unshift not taking arrays
	for pushing, only first element was getting pushed. pointed out by
	Bjarne Steinsbø

	* examples/simplelist.pl: example of push/unshift array of arrays
	
	* t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: tests of push/unshift array of arrays

	* xs/GtkClipboard.xs: removed an unused function destroy_data, quited 
	some warnings in the same style as currently done.

2003/09/28 20:19 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: bugs found in _for_display functions, not accepting 
	class arguments.

2003/09/26 16:42 muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: be defensive and use exists() to check whether
	keys already exist in %column_types; this fixes a bug reported by
	Jaap Karssenberg, where supply a bad column type would tell you that
	column type was invalid, but include that bad name in the list of
	valid keys (because of autovivification).  (a lot of explaining for
	a simple bug.)

2003/09/26 26:25 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTextView.xs: new_with_buffer had class param but no spec for it
	this was not a bug, but now it's like everything else thoughout the 
	whole of Gtk2.

2003/09/26 03:45 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, META.yml, debian/changelog: prep for 1.00rc3 release

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: Gtk2::SimpleList->new_from_treeview allows an
	existing Gtk2::TreeView to be turned into a SimpleList.  intended
	for Glade users.

	* xs/GtkClipboard.xs, api.pod: several nasty bugs mean that this
	module couldn't have worked as it was.  added class parameter to get
	and get_for_display.  implemented set_with_data and set_with_owner.
	made the others actually work.

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GtkSelection.xs: moved the macro to gtk2perl.h as
	GTK2PERL_STACK_ITEMS_TO_TARGET_ENTRY_ARRAY so clipboard could use it.

	* t/27.GtkClipboard.t, MANIFEST: new test.

	 * xs/GtkStyle.xs: somehow we had implemented the deprecated
	 gtk_draw_flat_box instead of gtk_paint_flat_box.

2003/09/24 14:15 muppetman

	* api.pod, xs.GtkWidget.xs, t/01.GtkWidget.xs: simplify
	gtk_widget_intersect to return either a rectangle or undef.

2003/09/24 11:39 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented several missing functions
 
        * t/01.GtkWindow.t: test a couple of the above

	* api.pod: document where the api of the above changes differes from 
	their c couterparts

2003/09/21 20:19 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: fixed bug in specfile generation

2003/09/21 19:58 rwmcfa1

	* (lots of files): license updates/additions

2003/09/21 11:18 muppetman

	* AUTHORS: torsten's officially on the team now.

2003/09/18 23:10 muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: added new_from_widget(), which allows glade users
	to use SimpleLists.  this basically just re-blesses the treeview that
	comes in, which means it won't work if we ever change SimpleList to be
	a proper Glib::Object subclass.

2003/09/19 00:53 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, META.yml, debian/control, debian/changelog:
	updated for the 1.00rc2 release.

	* Makefile.PL: updated requirements

2003/09/17 10:44 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: ExtUtils::PkgConfig can now deal with version 
	requirements using pkg-config's interface, make use of it.

2003/09/16 23:50 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL, perl-*spec.in: somewhat automated versioning system 
	implemented for depenancy modules

2003/09/16 15:00 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: don't do any of the hand-coded install stuff on
	windows --- there's no sane place to install, and nmake barfs on
	the generated makefile code.

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs: unused variables

	* xs/GdkGC.xs, xs/GdkTypes.xs, xs/GtkCurve.xs, xs/GtkTreeView.xs:
	casts to hush pedantic compilers

2003/09/15 22:26 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: spec file dependancies improved

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: fixed ref count bug.

2003/09/15 16:02 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: remove Gtk2::Dialog::Responses, add a bunch of missing
	L<links>

	* Makefile.PL, gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl, xs/GtkDialog.xs: use
	gperl_signal_set_marshaller_for() to set a custom marshaller for
	GtkDialog's response signal, so we can get the enum string values
	for the response id in the response handler instead of negative
	numbers.  removes the need for Gtk2::Dialog::Responses, so that
	ugly wart is now gone as well.  Gtk2 now requires Glib 1.00rc2.

	* MANIFEST, pm/Responses.pm (deleted): delete Responses.pm.

2003/09/15 14:02 muppetman

	the ones that got away...
	* xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: remove unused private function
	* xs/GtkNotebook.xs, xs/GtkTreeStore.xs: remove unused variable
	* xs/GtkToolbar.xs: initialize the uninitialized

2003/09/14 15:44 rwmcfa1

	* xs/(most everything): quiet warnings from -Wall, and/or add void
	comments

	* xs/GdkDisplay.xs: added const qualifier to gchar * return value

	* xs/GdkDnd.xs: copy-and-paste bug fixed, get_protocol(_for_display)

	* xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: formatting cleanup

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: quited warning about invalid paramter type

	* xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: non-void paramter with PPCODE, fixed

	* xs/GtkTearoffMenuItem.xs: teamoff -> tearoff, big bug

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: looking for -1 list terminator incorrectly, 
	bug-fix

2003/09/14 01:31 muppetman

	* maps: remove some deprecated types
	* xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: implement gtk_icon_set_render_icon

2003/09/14 01:09 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTextIter.xs: implement gtk_text_iter_get_tags()

2003/09/11 23:51 muppetman

	* ChangeLog, Gtk2.pm, MANIFEST, META.yml, README, debian/changelog,
	debian/control: updated for 1.00rc1 release

	* Makefile.PL: require Glib 1.00rc1

2003/09/11 23:41 muppetman

	* examples/histogramplot.pl: update to use the new, fixed overrides
	features of Glib::Object::Subclass in Glib 1.00rc1.

2003/09/11 11:01 rwmcfa1

	* t/*.t: use strict and use warnings added and fixes made to allow
	things to run with them.

2003/09/10 15:04 rwmcfa1

	* examples/socket.pl: make the same change in here that was made in 
	the plug socket test way back when, use the perl socket is being run
	with to run the plug script.

2003/09/09 21:35 muppetman

	* t/22.GtkListStore.t, t/23.GtkTreeStore.t, t/24.GtkTreeView.t,
	 t/25.GtkTreeSelection.t: patch from torsten uses isa_ok() instead
	 of is(ref(), ...) all over the place.

2003/09/09 21:22 muppetman

	* pm/Responses.pm, Gtk2.pm, Makefile.PL, gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl,
	MANIFEST: tiny module adds named constants for the dialog responses,
	with pod

	* pm/Pango.pm: update the link in the see also section


2003/09/09 19:52 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: new rule to install examples/gtk-demo

        * perl-Gtk2.spec: use new ^ rule to put examples and demo in bin rpm

        * gtk-demo/appwindow.pl: fixed small bug with demo_find_file from last
        commit.

2003/09/09 17:28 rwmcfa1

	* gtk-demo/(various): fixed things so that you do not have to be in the
	gtk-demo directory to run it. the files just have to be in the same dir
	as main.pl

2003/09/08 23:15 muppetman

	* xs/GtkNotebook.xs, api.pod: ensure that the second parameter to 
	append_page, prepend_page and insert_page is always a widget by 
	stringifying and wrapping a label around anything that's not a
	Gtk2::Widget.

2003/09/07 15:57 muppetman

	* api.pod, xs/GtkTreeView.xs: patch from torsten makes get_path_at_pos
	return just the path in scalar context.

	* xs/GtkTreeStore.xs, xs/GtkListStore.xs: trap invalid columns supplied
	to $(tree|list)store->set at the binding level, because the error
	message from gtk doesn't make much sense.  (torsten's idea)

2003/09/06 19:23 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: dist-rpms build target added

	* perl-Gtk2.spec.in: initial import

2003/09/05 01:02 muppetman

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: route Gtk-related g_log domains through gperl

	* MANIFEST: updated

	* xs/GdkRgb.xs: keep SvImageDataPointer private

2003/09/04 22:20 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, debian/changelog, META.yml, ChangeLog: prep for
	0.97 release

	* gtk2perl.h: export gtk2perl_menu_position_func

	* Gtk2.exports, Makefile.PL: add exports file

2003/09/04 18:48 rwmcfa1

	* MANIFEST: gtk.typemap and t/26.GtkSimpleMenu.t added.

2003/09/03 18:37 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleMenu.pm: pod doc added, no longer keep entries and menu_tree
	around unless we're asked to.

	* t/26.GtkSimpleMenu.t: inital import

2003/08/31 19:59 muppetman

	* CodeGen.pm, gdk.typemap: use Glib's new T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER to
	cut out 2/3 of the typemap code.

	* Gtk2.pm: don't set RTLD_GLOBAL on darwin, it generates a warning.

	* Makefile.PL, README: we now require Glib 0.97 for 
	T_GPERL_GENERIC_WRAPPER.

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GtkDnd.xs, xs/GtkSelection.xs, gtk.typemap: implement
	GtkTargetList and several of the drag'n'drop APIs that depend on it.
	done with custom code, as these are apparently somewhat internal
	structures that don't have built-in boxed type support.

2003/08/30 02:33 muppetman

	changes made while listening to cheesy 80s scandinavian prog metal in
	the middle of the night while everyone's asleep (oh, the nostalgia):

	* AUTHORS, xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: patch from Anuradha Ratnaweera implements
	Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf->new_from_xpm_data

	* examples/timeouttest.pl: apparently this was broken for a long time.

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: updated commentary.

2003/08/28 23:17 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, debian/changelog: updated for 0.96 release

	* xs/GtkCalendar.xs: celendar members patch from chas, mangled by me

2003/08/28 10:09 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: slight modifications of a patch by thierry vignaud 
	applied. impelements text direction functions.

2003/08/28 08:44 rwmcfa1

	* t/24.GtkTreeView.t: torsten's patch applied to fix "assertion
	`column_in_tree' failed" problem on various systems/versions. cached
	version info into an array and then use rather than getting it over and
	over.

2003/08/27 18:43 muppetman

	another round of treeview-related patched from torsten:
	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: a few more missing functions
	* t/22.GtkListStore.t t/23.GtkTreeStore.t t/24.GtkTreeView.t: new tests
	* t/22.GtkTreeSelection.t, t/25.GtkTreeSelection.t: renamed and updated
	* MANIFEST: updated accordingly

2003/08/25 13:40 pcg

        * t/04.GtkSocket-GtkPlug.t: Applied patch by Skye Cove to add
        -Mblib. Also change ctrl-x character to the more readable (and
        transferable) ^X.

2003/08/22 01:38 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README, MANIFEST, META.yml, debian/changelog:
	updated for 0.95 release

2003/08/21 14:22 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: even yet still another patch from torsten,
	implementing gtk_tree_path_new_from_indices and fixing thr broken
	signature of gtk_tree_row_reference_new.  i took some liberties with
	the patch, making it croak with a helpful message on the -1 that will
	inevitably be passed in by people who read the C API reference.  i also
	removed the separate binding of new_from_string and aliased it into
	new, since new already calls new_from_string if you supply a string.

	* api.pod: mention how new_from_indices differs from the C func,
	and actually commit the accel group stuff i thought i commited
	yesterday.

2003/08/20 14:27 muppetman

	* t/22.GtkTreeSelection.t: new test, another patch from torsten

2003/08/20 12:39 rwmcfa1

	* api.pod: url of stock items strings added, thierry vignaud

	* t/04.GtkSocket-GtkPlug.t: make sure that forked perl runs under the
	same interperter that it does, calle dybedahl

2003/08/20 04:20 muppetman

	* TODO, examples/accel_groups.pl, xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs, api.pod:
	implemented a bunch of the GtkAccelGroup stuff, with an example.

2003/08/20 01:45 muppetma

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: patch from Torsten Schoenfeld implements
	gtk_tree_selection_set_select_function and
	gtk_tree_selection_selected_foreach

	* xs/GtkContainer.xs, t/21.GtkContainer.t: implemented a slew of
	missing GtkContainer methods, with a test.  the functions for child
	properties are still unbound.

	* xs/GtkTreeDnd.xs: missing functions gtk_tree_get_row_drag_data
	and gtk_tree_drag_source_drag_data_get.  changed package for
	gtk_tree_(get|set)_row_drag_data to Gtk2::SelectionData so they
	will be called properly as methods.

	* xs/GtkImage.xs: implemented the functions to do with GdkImages
	and GdkPixbufAnimations

	* xs/GtkStyle.xs api.pod: implement $style->render_icon and
	$style->paint_polygon

2003/08/19 22:52 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: implemented gtk_text_buffer_insert_with_tags,
	torsten schoenfeld

	* xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: corrected error message, torsten schoenfeld

2003/08/19 21:11 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: added realclean removal of build dir to postamble 
	section.

2003/08/19 21:11 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleMenu.pm, examples/simple_menu.pl: initial versions, and
	example of how to use it, pod still to come.

	* Makefile.PL: added realclean removal of build dir to postamble 
	section. install SimpleMenu.pm

2003/08/19 10:19 rwmcfa1

	* api.pod: url added for location of stock item strings, thierry
	vignaud

	* t/04.GtkSocket-GtkPlug.t: 

2003/08/19 10:19 rwmcfa1

	* t/*.t: fixed things so that test do not fail if init_check fails,
	this is so that it can be build without a DISPLAY. tests are skipped
	and a warning message is printed by Test::More. in reality passing
	this doesn't mean much more than Gtk2 will load, but without a display
	that's all that can be done.

2003/08/18 17:24 muppetman

	* README: remove FIXME: we do have more docs, they're linked
	from Gtk2.pm

	* api.pod: updated.

	* gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl: a few more tweaks.  it almost works.

	* t/07.GtkBoxes.t: this is the most obvious place for tests for
	widget tools, since this test plays with packing boxes and such.

	* xs/GdkDisplay.xs: flesh out the get_window_at_pointer xsub, else
	the changedisplay.pl demo says it can't do something with a CODE
	reference.  (i don't understand...)

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: apparently $gdkwindow->get_user_data isn't the
	same as GObject user data...

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: consolidating void $widget->method($void) methods
	into one ALIASED xsub saved over 2K in the object file, even with
	the other ten or so such methods implemented.  wow.
	also implemented get_ancestor, is_ancestor gtk_widget_modify_style
	gtk_widget_get_modifier_style gtk_widget_path gtk_widget_class_path.

2003/08/18 11:54 muppetman

	went for a complete audit of xs/*.xs, looking for FIXMEs and 
	unimplemented functions.  this is part of that completeness sweep.

	* xs/GdkPixmap.xs xs/GtkClipboard.xs xs/GtkDnd.xs xs/GtkItemFactory.xs
	xs/GtkMenu.xs xs/GtkTextIter.xs xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs xs/PangoFont.xs
	xs/PangoLayout.xs xs/PangoContext.xs: updated FIXME comments

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: updated FIXMEs, implemented several missing functions

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: quit_add_destroy, get_current_event, 
	get_current_event_(time|state), get_event_widget

	* xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs xs/GtkHButtonBox.xs xs/GtkVButtonBox.xs
	xs/GtkHScale.xs xs/GtkVScale.xs xs/GtkWindow.xs: some static methods
	were implemented incorrectly (not taking the class parameter).
	this fixes that, but will break any code that used it.  since i've
	not heard any complaints, i assume no-one is using it.  at any rate,
	it was wrong, is now right.

	* xs/GtkButtonBox.xs xs/GtkMenuShell.xs xs/GtkPlug.xs xs/GtkScale.xs
	xs/GtkTextTag.xs xs/GtkTooltips.xs: removed commented implementation
	of private function; it will never be bound

	* xs/GtkEntry.xs: update FIXME comments, implement get_layout and
	get_layout_offesets

	* xs/GtkLabel.xs: implemented (get|set)_attributes

	* xs/GtkList.xs xs/GtkSelection.xs xs/GtkStock.xs xs/GtkTreeModel.xs
	xs/GtkTreeView.xs: clarified commentary

	* xs/GtkListStore.xs xs/GtkTreeStore.xs gtk2perl.h: implement
	gtk_(list|tree)_store_set_column_types, since it is now possible
	to derive GObject types in perl; this is necessary to implement
	the constructor of a derived list or tree store.  factored out
	the stack handling code, into gtk2perl.h, to avoid needing to
	create another header.

	* xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: implemented missing clipboard functions:
	add_selection_clipboard remove_selection_clipboard cut_clipboard
	copy_clipboard paste_clipboard

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented get_pointer, is_ancestor,
	translate_coordinates, set_style, ensure_style; added FIXMEs

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: let gdk_event_set_screen in there twice, because
	i wasn't building against 2.2.x.  fixed.

2003/08/18 03:56 muppetman

	* TODO: updates

	* xs/Gdk.xs: update some FIXMEs, implement the gdk_threads stuff

	* xs/GdkColor.xs, api.pod, t/20.GdkColor.t: gdk_colormap_alloc_colors,
	free_colors, and query_color

	* xs/GdkDisplay.xs, xs/GdkDrawable.xs, xs/GdkPixbuf.xs,
	xs/GdkPixbufLoader.xs, xs/GdkRgb.xs: update some FIXMEs

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs, xs/GdkGC.xs: more missing functions and FIXMEs

2003/08/15 18:06 rwmcfa1

	* t/01.GtkWindow.t: fixed bug 'ok' -> 'is' causing really strange 
	makemaker warnings. didn't have anything to do with libs. bad muppet,
	no cookie for you...

2003/08/15 09:35 muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm, AUTHORS: patch from Dr. Michael Langner,
	allowing 0 to be a value in the tied list, implementing the SPLICE
	operation, and adding a new column type, 'hidden'.  many thanks!

	* debian/*: patch from James Curbo adding maintainence files for
	debian packages.

	* devel.pod, Makefile.PL: more docs

	* Gtk2.pm, README: updated for 0.94 release

2003/08/14 22:43 muppetman

	busy day, busy day...

	* t/00.Gtk2.t, t/16.GtkMenu-etc.t, t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: patch from
	Torsten Schoenfeld hushes some warnings in make test

	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs: another TreeView patch from Torsten, hacked up
	a bit by me, to add some callbacks.  get_search_equal_func isn't
	bound because there's really no reliable and not easily-broken way
	to return a function pointer value or a code reference and then know
	what to do with them on the other end.  (presumably for restoring
	the search func after setting it.)  also, i left out the 
	destroy_count_func stuff, as the docs say they are supposed to be
	private.

	* t/04.GtkSocket-GtkPlug.t: i did it wrong.  i swear it works,
	this time.

2003/08/14 16:59 muppetman

	* t/04.GtkSocket-GtkPlug.t: skip this test on win32

	* Makefile.PL: find_extra_libs is a hack to look through the perl
	library tree for the library created when the Glib module was 
	installed, so we can add that to the libs line for Gtk2.  this is
	necessary because win32 doesn't allow unresolved symbols in anything,
	so we can't link to the all-important gperl_* without this.
	*grumble*

	* t/01.GtkWindow.t: true and false are not enums; use constants for
	them and get around some hidden bugs; try to skip tests that aren't
	available on windows.  number of tests didn't match up on various
	versions because of improper method of skipping tests... i think it
	works right now.

2003/08/14 12:00 muppetman

	* TODO: updates

	* xs/GdkPixmap.xs, gtk-demo/textview.pl: a GdkBitmap is a GdkPixmap
	with depth 1.  so, set Gtk2::Gdk::Pixmap in @Gtk2::Gdk::Bitmap rather
	than Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable.  this fixes a couple of annoying FIXMEs."

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: cleanup and commentary

	* xs/GdkDisplay.xs, xs/GdkDisplayManager.xs, gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl:
	a couple more >=2.2 objects to make the changedisplay demo work.
	dunno if it actually works with more than one display, because i
	only have one here, but it doesn't crash like before...

2003/08/11 12:52 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs, AUTHORS: patch from Torsten Schoenfeld to enable
	drag and drop stuff for TreeView

2003/08/09 23:31 pcg

	* Makefile.PL: some more Win32 and command.com fixes.

2003/08/08 12:09 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README: pod updates, bump version to 0.93

	* Makefile.PL: use makefile variables for manpage extensions (idea
	suggested by Roderich Schupp, thanks)

	* genkeysyms.pl: add pod to generated file

2003/08/06 23:19 rwmcfa1

	* Makefile.PL: .pm -> .3pm copy and paste bug corrected, spotted by 
	James Curbo

2003/08-06 16:58 ggc

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: add gtk_widget_size_request

2003/08/06 12:57 muppetman

	* xs/GtkWindow.xs: plug a memleak in list_toplevels

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: ->get_clipboard

2003/08/05 22:16 muppetman

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: pod patch from James Curbo

2003/08/01 12:45 muppetman

	* MANIFEST, Gtk2.pm, README, Makefile.PL: updated for 0.92 release

2003/07/31 20:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: mention Gtk2::api and Gtk2::SimpleList manpages

	* Makefile.PL: install api.pod so perldoc can find it.

	* examples/simplelist.pl, pm/SimpleList.pm, t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: add
	simple interfaces to editable text cells and index-based selection
	handling; modify and clarify other pod.

	* xs/GtkTextView.xs: fixed get_iter_at_location to work correctly.

	* gtk-demo/textview.pl: clean up some flotsam and jetsam

	* CodeGen.pm: register GEnum and GFlags types with the bindings,
	so they can be used as column types

2003/07/29 22:06 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: first pass at pod documentation done, small version
	bump, the on load warning has been removed.

	* examples/simplelist.pl, t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: added examples/tests
	for a more complex custom column type, sum_of_array, it better shows
	the power of the custom column system.

2003/07/29 14:52 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleList.pm: added code to allow users (well programmers anyway) 
	to define their own column types, scalar impelements this in a simple
	example. this is very powerful and very cool, check it out.

	* t/19.GtkSimpleList.t, examples/simplelist.pl: make use of and
	exemplify the cool new custom column types interface. also get pixbuf's
	from a more relable source. both scalars and pixbuf's are more fully
	demonstraighted/tested.


2003/07/25 10:21 rwmcfa1

	* pm/SimpleList.pm, t/19.GtkSimpleList.t: initial versions, lots of 
	known bugs, submitted for testing, approval and suggests.

2003/07/25 10:21 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README: bump version to 0.91

2003/07/25 03:41 pcg

	* xs/GtkCurve.xs: avoid calling set_vector with zero veclen
        to avoid segfault.

2003/07/24 16:37 muppetman

	* xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: add g_filename_(from|to)_utf8 to 
	gtk_file_selection_(get|set)_filename.

2003/07/24 09:40 rwmcfa1

	* t/01.GtkWindow.t: we aren't assured that a window will be the exact
	size that we ask it to be, so setting and testing that it is isn't a 
	good thing.

2003/07/24 08:31 muppetman

	* xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: get_selections was broken; simplified the
	loop and used newSVGChar instead of newSVpv.

2003/07/24 00:56 pcg

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GtkPlug.xs, xs/GtkSocket.xs: don't build these
        for the win32 backend. It defines the macros, but doesn't actually
        provide them.
        * xs/GtkRadioButton.xs: remove extra aliases (saves memory and
        avoids extra symbols).

2003/07/23 16:46 muppetman

	* README, Makefile.PL: update required versionf of Gtk2 and Glib to
	ensure that the gchar_own typemap (introduced in 0.90) is available.

	* xs/GtkImage.xs: get_pixbuf

2003/07/22 17:31 rwmcfa1

	* xs/Gtk2.pm: much discussed immproved handling of the create_item via
	hash handling, now complains on bad keys. thanks to Joe Smith and Brett 
	Kosinski for their input.

2003/07/22 16:41 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: more _ornulls

	* AUTHORS: add thierry, who should've been in a couple weeks ago

2003/07/21 07:36 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: Gtk2::TreeModel->get now returns an array of all
	of the columns when no column id's are passed, documented in api.pod,
	shouldn't affect anything normal documented api

2003/07/18 12:00 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeSortable.xs: implemented the missing sort callbacks.

	* Gtk2.pm, README, Makefile.PL, META.yml: bump version to 0.90 for
	first beta series release.  require at least Glib 0.26.

2003/07/17 11:35 muppetman

	* xs/GdkX11.xs: a few x11-backend-specific functions from gdkx.h,
	only used on the X11 backend.

	* xs/GdkRgb.xs: hackish implementations for some rarely-used but
	handy gdk-rgb stuff.

2003/07/16 10:04 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs, xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/GtkWidget.xs: more
	instances of returning '_own'ed wrappers for stack items.
	coverted all of them to '_copy's.

2003/07/15 20:28 rwmcfa1

	* t/18.GtkNotebook.t: almost, if not, complete testing of 
	Gtk2::Notebook.

2003/07/15 08:29 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkNotebook.xs: allowed NULL's, and defaulted to them, as 
	appropriate for both parameters and return values in a lot of places,
	one of which Thierry Vignaud pointed out.

2003/07/14 22:30 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: bugfix, can't _own_ornull something that wasn't
	dynamically allocated.

2003/07/14 20:44 rwmcfa1

	* t/00.Gtk2.t: more thorough testing, init_add, quit_add, 
	quit_add_remove.

	* t/01.GtkWindow.t: much more thorough testing, but not complete. 
	general re-org.

	* t/02.GtkButton.t: pretty nearly complete testing

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: implemented first pass at init_add, quit_add, and 
	quit_add_remove.

	* xs/GtkWindow.xs: title defaults to NULL in set_title. get_icon is 
	allowed (and does) return NULL when there are no icons associated with
	the window, api doc doesn't mention this. window_list_toplevels 
	implemented

2003/07/14 15:05 muppetman

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: back out the OUTLIST stuff for get_pointer.
	i don't understand why, but the OUTLIST form causes get_pointer
	to break in examples/histogramplot.pl and examples/scribble.pl.

2003/07/11 13:22 muppetman

	* xs/GtkIconFactory.xs, gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl: make some fixes
	to stock handling to make it more robust when local implementations
	add custom stock items without icons or proper sizes; i don't know
	what's up with redhat 9, but this makes the stock browser work there.

2003/07/09 13:39 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs, api.pod, gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl,
	gtk-demo/editable_cells.pl: reverse order of return values on
	$tree_selection->get_selected; now conforms to C API and old
	gtk2-perl.  still returns $iter in scalar context.

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: add process_updates and process_all_updates,
	convert hand-coded stuff to OUTLIST

	* gtk-demo/tree_store.pl, gtk-demo/main.pl: cleanup

2003/07/09 10:47 rwmcfa1

	* xs/Gdk.xs: accept nulls for confine_to and cursor parameters of
	gdk_pointer_grab

2003/07/08 15:38 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: uncommented the freeze/thaw updates functions per
	thierry vignaud's request.

	* xs/GtkCheckButton.xs: duplicate alias value found by ^

2003/07/08 14:23 muppetman

	* CodeGen.om: massive POD update; use regex to find module name
	instead of relying on people putting whitespace around the '='

2003/07/07 23:10 muppetman

	* CodeGen.pm: slight rework of write_boot.  now you can pass in an
	arbitrary regex for modules to be ignored; the default is still to
	ignore any module that has no :'s in its name.  this fix allows us
	to use write_boot for packages like Gnome::Canvas, which *do* have
	colons in the name of the package that needs to be ignored.
	    also reimplemented the MODULE search to avoid needing grep,
	which is conspicuously absent on most win32 systems.
	    this changes the call signature of write_boot, but all the
	defaults are the same and no module in gtk2-perl-xs was actually
	using anything non-default.  sorry if this breaks you, but it's
	for the best.

2003/07/07 23:03 rwmcfa1

	* t/17.GtkItemFactory.t: added test for item factory

2003/07/06 17:30 muppetman

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: gtk_set_locale().

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version for cvs devel series

2003/07/05 06:06 pcg

        * xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkClipboard.xs: use length() syntax.

        * xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkRc.xs, xs/Gdk.xs, xs/GdkProperty.xs,
        xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs, xs/GtkEditable.xs,
        xs/GtkFontSelection.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs: use gchar_own* as
        result type to free the strings and avoid memleaks where no
        CLEANUP existed.

        * xs/GtkTextIter.xs: uncomment get_visible_slice and
        get_visible_text.

        * xs/GtkListItem.xs: fix #endif.

2003/07/04 16:31 muppetman

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: added gdk_get_default_root_window

	* xs/PangoFont.xs: added PANGO_PIXELS

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version for release

2003/06/27 17:01 pcg

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: gdk_window_set_back_pixmap allows null pixmap.

        * pm/Pango.pm: fix typo.

        * api.pod: small doc changes (basically proofreading for the new
        wrappers model).

2003/06/27 17:00 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: require bleeding edge Glib.

	* gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, gtk-demo/item_factory.pl,
	gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, testgtk.pl: remove bad usage of
	set_data and get_data

	* examples/histogramplot.pl: rewritten with new Glib::Object::Subclass
	features.

2003/06/26 14:49 rwmcfa1

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP: the manifest was updated to include a few
	missing files and a MANIFEST.SKIP file was added to simplify the
	process in the future.

	* Gtk2.pm: cleaned up some of the ItemFactory stuff esp. error messages

	* xs/GtkItemFactor.xs: reworked all of the callback stuff, needs 
	verification

	* examples/item_factory_demo.pl: added, simple exmaple of how to 
	use Gtk2::ItemFactory

2003/06/26 13:48 muppetman

	* pm/Pango.pm: new file allows you to import the Pango constants.

	* Gtk2.pm: allow 'use Gtk2 -init', a la gtk-perl; bumped version
	to 0.25 for CVS.

	* Makefile.PL: add Pango.pm and api.pod to install; install manpages.

	* gtk-demo/images.pl: use normal operators rather than ->eq (works on
	overloaded and persistent wrappers)

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: support for requisitions as writable objects.
	needed for supporting size_request event.

	* xs/GtkStock.xs: watch out for NULLs in stock_item_to_hv; this fixes
	a crash that resulted whenever the stock browser wasn't the first
	thing opened in gtk-demo.

2003/06/26 01:11 pcg

	* META.yml: Add module meta-data in YAML for CPAN.

2003/06/24 08:58 rwmcfa1

	* maps: added GTK_TYPE_LIST and GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM

	* xs/GtkList.xs, xs/GtkListItem.xs: initial import required for use of
	Gtk2::Combo from perl even though they are both deprecated. in the 
	future hopefully this won't be necessary. (also added files to the
	MANIFEST)

2003/06/23 12:07 pcg

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implement {get,create}_pango_context.

2003/06/22 13:37 pcg

        * gtk-demo/*: fix various minor problems, including using
        binmode for binary streams, and removing misleading "use bytes".

        * xs/GdkPixbufLoader.xs: the right way to access scalars is *not*
        SvPVX, but SvPV. Also removed "count" from ->write, since strings
        in perl are always counted and exposing this c-ism gives no benefit.

        * Makefile.PL: change the glib-not-found error message to the perl
        standard.

        * xs/GdkWindow.xs: enabled various non-deprecated methods I needed
        but weren't implemented yet, plus some rarely used ones.

        * t/01.GtkWindow.t: compare references with == not eq, and
        "$x == undef" is not the right way to tets defined'ness.

2003/06/20 11:33 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README: bump version for 0.24 release

	* Makefile.PL: just seeing if Glib is available isn't enough, make
	sure it's recent enough, too.  oh, and bump the required glib 
	version while we're at it

2003/06/19 13:46 joered
	* xs/GdkColor.xs: added accessors for GdkColor struct members.

2003/06/19 00:58 pcg

	* Makefile.PL: write a fake Makefile using PREREQ when important
        modules are missing, this ensures auto-installation within CPAN.

2003/06/18 10:48 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: catch undefined values to hush warnings

	* xs/GtkMenu.xs, xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: change stack handling to
	avoid attempting to free undef.

2003/06/17 18:21 muppetman

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GtkObject.xs: push sink functions into Glib, 
	to avoid some problems in which GtkObject created via 
	Glib::Object->new don't have gtk_object_sink called on them.

2003/06/16 22:25 muppetman

	* xs/GdkColor.xs, gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl: not sure how the GBoxed
	change could excite this, but suddenly gdk_color_free is very unhappy
	with the GdkColors created by Gtk2::Gdk::Color->new and ->parse.
	fixed by using gdk_color_copy instead of g_new.  freaky.

2003/06/16 22:21 pcg

        * xs/GtkAdjustment.xs: two minor typoes, found while porting
        gimp-perl to 1.3. Reply to muppetman becomes urgent slowly.

2003/06/16 22:36 joered

	* xs/Gtk2/GtkTextIter.xs: fixed a memory leak. Thanks to
	  muppet for the hint.

2003/06/16 14:31 muppetman

	* xs/GtkStyle.xs, AUTHORS: patch from Tom Hargreaves (hex at freezone 
	dot co dot uk> makes font_desc work correctly.

	* api.pod: nasty typo in example code

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkEvent.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: updated to reflect
	changes in Glib-Perl's GBoxed handling.

2003/06/15 17:03 joered

	* xs/Gtk2/GtkTextIter.xs: added binding for gtk_text_iter_copy

2003/06/12 20:27 muppetman

	* xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/PangoTabs.xs: newly implemented

2003/06/12 18:06 pcg

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: enable add_events, set/get_extension_events.

2003/06/09 13:49 muppetman

	* xs/GtkClipboard.xs: new stuff; 2.2.x only, so only smoke-tested on
	my end...

2003/06/08 16:40 muppetman

	* api.pod: merged in stuff from the braindump

2003/06/07 18:51 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: implemented treemodel->foreach, and some others.

	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs: argument defaults patch from rene seindal 

2003/06/06 23:55 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, xs/GdkProperty.xs, xs/GdkSelection.xs: added stuff for
	handling GdkAtoms and selections and such.  it appears to have
	some problems, but i don't know if they are binding problems or what.

	* MANIFEST: added several missing files, make dist makes something
	appropriate, now.

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped version number to 0.22 for public release.

2003/06/06 11:39 pcg

        * xs/GtkTextTagTable.xs: new file, all methods of GtkTextTagTable.

2003/06/05 10:53 rwmcfa1

	* t/[0-9]*: prepended 0's onto the front of the 0 - 9 tests to improve
	order. 

2003/06/02 18:10 muppetman

	another patch from marc lehmann:

	* xs/GtkAdjustment.xs: added accessors and mutators for struct members

	* gtk-demo/textview.pl: fix demo to actually use unicode as opposed
	to the garbled latin1.

2003/06/02 12:24 muppetman

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs: allow enum strings as well as integers to
	$dialog->response

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: remove unused parameters

2003/06/01 22:52 muppetman

	* xs/GtkAspectFrame.xs, GtkTreeSortable.xs: fixed package typos;
	change Gtk2::AspectFrame::set to set_params to avoid clashing with
	Glib::Object::set.  (patch from Marc Lehmann, pcg at goof dot com)

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: patch from rene seindal, remove model from
	return value of get_selected_rows.

2003/05/31 11:07 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkRc.xs: implemented gtk_rc_set_default_files

2003/05/28 14:02 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: decent diagnostic messages for missing Glib modules

2003/05/27 20:44 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkSelection.xs: gtk 2.2 function
	gtk_selection_owner_set_for_display didn't have the appropriate C_ARGS
	section ommitting the class parameter

2003/05/27 18:50 muppetman

	implementing missing bindings for selection handling and drag and 
	drop stuff.

	* xs/GdkDnd.xs, xs/GtkDnd.xs, xs/GtkSelection.xs, examples/testdnd.pl:
	new files

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GdkTypes.xs, gdk.typemap: added type handling for
	GdkAtom and GtkTargetEntry

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: added get_colormap

2003/05/27 14:38 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: get_style was missing, in it's place was style,
	they're aliases of one another now.

2003/05/26 23:58 muppetman

	* xs/GtkMenu.xs: get_attach_widget

2003/05/26 04:05 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped version number for development series 0.21

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: wrapped get_selected_rows and
	count_selected_rows for 2.2 and implemented them for 2.0.x;
	get_selected handles scalar context gracefully.

2003/05/26 21:04 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: bug fixed at insert_at_cursor. was taking an
	iter for some reason, was otherwise correct.

2003/05/22 10:30 muppetman

	* AUTHORS, LICENSE, *: added copyright and license info to just about
	every file, and pointers to the AUTHORS file which contains the list
	of who's responsible for this mess.

2003/05/18 14:00 muppetman

	* ChangeLog: since breaking the monolithic build into pieces, 
	ChangeLog entries for Gtk2 will be in here.  i've included the 
	contents of the toplevel log up to this point for history.

	* MANIFEST: updated for proper make dist

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped up the version number.

	* Makefile.PL: require Glib >= 0.20

	* README: updated

2003/05/17 09:06 rwmcfa1

	* Glade/*: first pass at GladeXML added

	* Makefile: added, see comments within

	* Makefile.PL: is no more

	* lots and lots of files: G -> Glib and other related/required changes

2003/05/16 14:55 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkSpinButton.xs: removed get_value_as_float because it is
	deprecated (and had the wrong return type anyway).

2003/05/15 11:45 muppetman

	* G/GSignal.xs: hush unused parameter warning, more efficient 
	this way, anyway

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkContainer.xs: implemented foreach

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: minor bugfix

	* G/GType.xs, G/GValue.xs, G/gperl.h, G/typemap,
	Gnome2/xs/GnomeProgram.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCombo.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkFrame.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: use newSVGChar
	and SvGChar instead of newSVpv and SvPV_nolen for gchar*, to ensure
	valid utf8 handling.  this definitely needs testing.

2003/05/06 12:56 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t, Gtk2/t/2.GtkButton.t: prevent windows from
	fighting over focus and thus stall tests (happends with wmaker)

	* Gtk2/t/16.GtkMenu-etc.t: we don't really know how to use 
	tearoff_state so for the time being we won't

2003/05/05 23:11 muppetman

	* G/G.pm, Gtk2/Gtk2.pm: pod updates

2003/05/05 16:35 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: work around a (bug|feature) in the Gtk+
	C library by storing a GtkTooltips reference in the GtkWidget's user
	data.  doesn't hurt normal behavior, and prevents some hard-to-explain
	pitfall errors.

2003/05/03 11:17  joered

	* Gtk2/: Gtk2.pm, Makefile.PL, pm/Helper.pm: removed deprecated
	timeout/idle/input methods from Gtk2.pm; added Gtk2/pm/Helper.pm
	with a convenience implementation of add_watch/remove_watch

2003/05/02 18:11 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/apple-red.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/background.jpg,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-applets.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-calendar.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-foot.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gimp.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gmush.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gsame.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnu-keys.png: images needed by Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl,
	directly from the gtk+-2.2.1 source distribution.

	* G/GType.xs, Gtk2/examples/histogramplot.pl: a bunch of code,
	borrowed from pygtk, to add signals to a derived class.
	altered the histogramplot example to use a new signal.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: allow tip_private to default to NULL

2003/05/02 00:30 muppetman

	* Gtk2/Gtk2.pm, Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/examples/scribble.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl, Gtk2/xs/Gdk.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs:
	reverted the whole GdkRectangle mess.  it's a boxed type again.
	this clears up several bugs to do with GdkAllocation, and in fact
	makes the whole shebang more efficient because we don't just create
	an array any time the GdkRectangle is needed, in which case it is
	often thrown away or only one element is used.  added a ->values
	function, like in gtk2-perl, which returns the members in a list
	in the order you'd want for passing to several important gdk
	functions.  Gtk2::Gdk::Rectangle->new is good for creating new
	rectangles.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextView.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented some
	functions found to be missing when looking for GdkRectangle returns
	that needed to be marked _copy.

2003/05/01 23:17 joered

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCombo.xs: added GtkCombo->entry and GtkCombo->list
	returning the correspondent widgets

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHBox.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVBox.xs: default homogenous is 0
	and default spacing is 5, as in gtk-perl

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: widget flags can now be set with
	Widget->flag_name(1) resp. unset with Widget->flag_name(0);
	Widget->flag_name() still returns current state

2003/05/01 08:00 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStyle.xs: removed deprecated functions, there was a lot 
	of them.

2003/04/31 01:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFrame.xs: properly allow undef in Gtk2::Frame->new (was
	adding an empty string instead of passing NULL)

	* Gtk2/xs/Gdk.xs, Gtk2/xs/GdkPixbufLoader.xs, Gtk2/xs/GdkRegion.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/PangoContext.xs, Gtk2/xs/PangoLayout.xs: newly implemented

	* Gtk2/examples/histogramplot.pl: new code to test drive drawing
	primitives, pango text handling and drawing, and subclassing.  lots
	of stuff in here; was ported from a working C class library i've
	been writing.

	* G/GType.xs, G/GObject.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkObject.xs: support for 
	pure-perl GObject subclasses.
	  added G::Type->register to create a new GType (basically wraps
	g_type_register_static), G::Object->_new, to be called from perl
	constructors for things inheriting GObject, and Gtk2::Object->new,
	which MUST be used for things inheriting GtkObject (to handle the
	floating ref situation properly).
	  this allows the perl developer to create new widgets without writing
	C code!  adding signals and properties is currently not implemented.

	* Gtk2/CodeGen.pm: more correct handling of undef --- previous code 
	was allowing a variable containing undef to pass, which would cause
	a croak in the wrapper-reader function.

	* Gtk2/Gtk2.pm, Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs: stopgap solution, simple lvalue 
	subs to get members from a rectangle list

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl: revert to named member method syntax
	for rectangles

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl: actually works now.  you need the images,
	which i don't think are in CVS yet.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl: cleanup

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixmap.xs: implemented create_from_xpm_d and
	colormap_create_from_xpm_d

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkWindow.xs: allow NULL for cursor in set_cursor

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented create_pango_layout

2003/04/29 21:55 joered

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: bugfix: gtk_list_store_append and
	gtk_list_store_prepend were swapped

2003/04/29 23:44 muppetman

	*  Gtk2/xs/GdkDrawable.xs: implemented gdk_draw_polygon,
	gdk_draw_points, gdk_draw_lines, gdk_draw_segments,
	gdk_draw_layout, and gdk_draw_layout_with_colors

	* G/GObject.xs: removed some very old and very broken commented-out
	code (wrapper instance caching).  added new methods for dealing with
	foreign objects in perl: G::Object->new_from_pointer(VAL, NOINC) (a
	direct wrapper around gperl_new_object), and $object->get_pointer.

2003/04/29 18:10 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: icon list stuff

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/images.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl: the last two
	pieces of gtk-demo (need some image files and such, though), and
	these two don't work correctly.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/button_box.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/colorsel.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/dialog.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/editable_cells.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/item_factory.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/list_store.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/main.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/menus.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/panes.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/sizegroup.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/textview.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/tree_store.pl: gtk-demo runs!  lots of cleanup in the
	pieces, and changed each one to us a single entry point name, defined
	in a package with the same name as the file; this bit of subterfuge
	was necessary because of the differences between C and perl, and the
	fact that the app is designed as a C program.  NOTE: drawingarea.pl
	is broken, because my copy has other changes that won't work with
	the current state of CVS.

2003/04/29 16:16 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkGC.xs: impelemted gdk_gc_set_dashes

2003/04/29 15:10 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkSizeGroup.xs: implemented size groups

	* Depends.pm, G/Depends.pm, G/Makefile.PL, Gnome2/Makefile.PL,
	GnomePrint2/Makefile.PL, Gtk2/Makefile.PL, GtkSpell/Makefile.PL,
	G/PkgConfig.pm, Gtk2/CodeGen.pm, helpers/genstuff.pl,
	helpers/genboot.pl: build system hacks.
	moved Depends.pm under G, so that G can install it.
	  made a module of some boilerplate to handle dealing with pkgconfig,
	and converted the code in helpers/genstuff.pl and helpers/genboot.pl
	into Gtk2/CodeGen.pm, stuff that can be called from Makefile.PLs.
	  hacked up a the Makefile.PLs to reflect these changes.
	  this makes it possible to use the autogen build tools outside the 
	source tree --- the first step towards breaking up the source tree 
	into separately distributable modules.

2003/04/29 11:14 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/sizegroup.pl: another little piece of my heart

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs: use alias to ensure that new_with_buttons
	exists for those who seek it.

2003/04/28 23:25 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeStore.xs: work around
	bizarre stack behavior by not using a helper function.  trying to
	read the stack in a helper function called from an xsub was resulting
	in the stack showing the wrong number of items.

2003/04/28 18:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/panes.pl: another piece of the gtk-demo pie

	* G/G.pm G/GObject.xs: overload the == operator, for more natural
	object comparisons

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkPaned.xs: struct member access

	* Gtk2/Makefile.PL Gtk2/genkeysyms.pl: create a big hash of key
	symbols in Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms, a la gtk-perl

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckButton.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkImageMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToggleButton.xs: consolidate
	constructors with ALIAS to avoid copying code.  make sure that
	group isn't a valid SV pointing to undef

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented queue_draw, add_accelerator,
	remove_accelerator, and get_display

2003/04/27 08:52- rwmcfa1
	
	* Gtk2/t/16.GtkMenu-etc.t: Added a first pass at the testing of
	GtkMenu and friends.

	* Gtk2/t/15.GtkHandleBox.t: Added a decently complete test of
	GtkHandleBox

	* Gtk2/t/14.GtkToolbar.t: Added a decently complete test of GtkToolbar

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs: Fixed a bug where GtkToolbarChildType was
	wrongly being used as a gtype, caused all _element functions to fail

	* Gtk2/t/13.GtkTooltips.t: Added a decently complete test of
	GtkTooltips

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: implemented an attempt at
	gtk_tooltips_data_get which returns what is in the GtkTooltipsData
	struct as a hash.

	* Gtk2/t/12.GtkDialog.t: Added a decently complete test of GtkDialog

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs: added gtk_dialog_add_butttons with multiple
	calls to gtk_dialog_add_button. combined the vbox and action_area get
	functions into one aliased function. also changed a char* to a gchar *

	* Gtk2/maps: hand added entry for Gtk2::Progress, removed

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkProgressBar.xs: added a BOOT section with a isa call to
	tell GtkProgressBar that it's a GtkWidget dependant.

2003/04/26 09:53- rwmcfa1

	* GtkSpell/Spell.pm: first pass of documentation

	* GtkSpell/GtkSpell.xs: gtkspell_get_from_text_view now accepts and
	ignores a class

	* Gtk2/t/10.GtkProgressBar.t, Gtk2/t/11.GtkStatusBar.t: first passes
	at testing the two modules

	* Gtk2/maps: hand added a (maybe temporary) entry for Gtk2::Progress

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkProgressBar.xs: removed a bunch of deprecated functions

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToggleButton.xs: now new with
	string new('string') uses mnemonic instead of label. seems like a good
	idea. you can use new_with_label if you don't want this behavior. also
	impelented news with aliases for new and new_with_mnemonic (saves code
	space/copying).

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkImageMenuItem.xs: same as ^ with the addition of: wrappers
	for _new_with_label were invalid they're now fixed.

	* GtkSpell/: Initial import of working (for me anyway) GtkSpell
	mappings, give them a try.

2003/04/25 18:17 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/editable_cells.pl: more demo pieces.  changedisplay.pl
	is completely untested, because i do not have Gtk+ 2.2 on my
	development machine.

	* G/GClosure.xs: always copy SVs that are to be stored.  see the
	perlcall manpage.  this fixes some intermittent bugs that happen
	when reusing the same variable for various objects.

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkWindow.xs: implemented gdk_window_invalidate_rect

	* new-gtk2-perl.html, G/GBoxed.xs, helpers/genstuff.pl, G/gperl.h,
	G/GObject.xs: renamed gperl_register_class to gperl_register_object
	to be more consistent (with gperl_register_fundamental and
	gperl_register_boxed).  also added
	gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass, made gperl_get_object
	honor it.

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkGC.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkStyle.xs: set 'no warn for unregistered
	subclasses on GtkStyle and GdkGC.  causes the type system to stop
	spewing messages on stderr about unregistered types from theme
	engines and gdk backends.

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/examples/scribble.pl, Gtk2/xs/GdkEvent.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs: completely reworked
	the handling of GdkRectangle.  it's now treated as a perl list
	instead of an opaque type; this is consistent with gtk-perl and
	makes life easier for manipulating the rectangles in perl.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: changed handling of GtkAllocation, since
	handling of GdkRectangle changed. invisible from the perl side.
	also implemented gtk_widget_get_events.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkImage.xs: implemented gtk_image_new_from_pixmap,
	gtk_image_set_from_pixmap, and gtk_image_get_pixmap

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkLabel.xs: allow Label->new to default to NULL for
	creating empty labels.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: implemented gtk_tree_path_get_indices

2003/04/25 12:40 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t: corrected check for gtk >= 2.2

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t: if 2.2 then try the reorder function

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCurve.xs: re-did set_vector to be clearer and removed a
	unused param name from prototype.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs:  clarified the a for loop's operations
	in get_selections

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeStore.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: added itital pass
	at _store_reorder

	* Gtk2/maps: added stuff new as of gtk2.2.1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkPlug.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs Gtk2/xs/GdkCursor.xs
	Gtk2/xs/GdkDrawable.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkInvisible.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkMenu.xs:
	uncommented stuff new to gtk 2.2 now that maps is up to date for 2.2.1

2003/04/24 18:24 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/button_box.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/colorsel.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/dialog.pl: more pieces of
	the demo

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs: implemented all the append/prepend/insert
	functions that were left out because they require callbacks

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs: implemented gtk_stock_add

	* G/GSignal.xs, G/gperl.h: export gperl_signal_connect, the actual
	workhorse, so other XSubs can use it

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkColorSelection.xs: fixed get_current_color and
	get_previous_color

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkColorSelectionDialog.xs: member access

	* TODO: high-level things (i forgot to commit this last week)

2003/04/24 17:55 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t: fixed type-o, datam -> data that was
	preventing entries being made into the list

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMessagedialog.xs: removed a TODO, it is probably better
	to just pass the message as you want it rather than use the varargs
	stuff anyway

2003/04/24 13:30 muppetman

	* Gnome2/xs/GnomeProgram.xs, Gnome2/druid.pl: implemented object
	properties on Gnome2::Program->init (was a FIXME)

	* G/GObject.xs: created alias get_property for get and set_property
	for set, since some objects mask the G::Object-level method with
	their own.  in list_properties, don't die if the descr isn't set.

2003/04/24 12:55 muppetman

	* helpers/genstuff.pl: wrap generated code in #ifdefs to support
	versioning (typemaps must be generated even if the code isn't, so
	we generate everything but only use part of it)

2003/04/23 10:44 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHButtonBox.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVButtonBox.xs:
	get_spacing_defaults should accept and ignore class

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h: type-o newSVGdkModiferType -> newSVGdkModifierType

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFontSelection.xs: type functions should not be in XS, it's
	all automagical

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: a first pass at set_icon_list_function added

2003/04/23 10:37 muppetman

	* ChangeLog: new change log, from the cvs log on sourceforge.
	please keep it updated.

2003/04/22 muppetman

	* G/GBoxed.xs: updates to debugging output

	* G/GClosure.xs: don't keep the supplemental arguments array in
	gperl_closure_marshal --- just put mortal values on the stack and
	everything works out fine.  simplifies the code quite a bit, and
	removes some subtle and nasty bugs.

	* G/GType.xs: GPERL_TYPE_SV, a boxed wrapper for perl scalars, mapped
	to the package G::Scalar.  this is handy for storing hashes and other
	perl data structures in a TreeModel.

	* G/GValue.xs: special handling for GPERL_TYPE_SV.  implement handling
	for G_TYPE_INTERFACE.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, Gtk2/xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: stock
	browser demo and some supporting code

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs: special handling for
	GdkModifierType flags...  GDK_MODIFIER_MASK matches all of the flag
	values, and causes nasty problems when you try to convert the SV flags
	wrapper *back* to C.  so, handle it separately, and don't allow
	GDK_MODIFIER_MASK to make it into perl from C. (can still go the other
	way, though)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: bracket callback with ENTER/SAVETMPS &
	FREETMPS/LEAVE

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMenu.xs: implemented gtk_menu_popup

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: it's possible for gtk_tree_model_iter_next
	to return NULL

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_view_insert_column_with_data_func

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: default params on set_size_request, and
	implemented render_icon

2003/04/22 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t, Gtk2/t/6.GtkLabel.t,
	Gtk2/t/7.GtkBoxes.t, Gtk2/t/8.GtkCombo.t: initial import

	* Gtk2/t/9.GtkRadioButton.t: test out a little more throughly

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: first pass at
	gtk_file_selection_get_selections, needs to be utf8
	tested/implemented maybe

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs: crash bug, need to make sure that svp
	exists

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs: first pass at implementing this class,
	not tested yet

2003/04/21 muppetman

	* G/G.xs, G/gperl.h: added gperl_alloc_temp

	* G/GClosure.xs: added GPerlCallback, and made some robustness fixes
	for GPerlClosure.  (there was bizarre stuff happening in the
	marshaller, wrong number of items in the supplemental arguments
	array.)

	* G/gperl.h: add GPerlCallback, with docs, and some other noise

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/item_factory.pl: gtk-demo driver for GtkItemFactory

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: implemented GtkItemFactory

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: set_flags and unset_flags

2003/04/21 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs: implement all of the functions now with a
	first pass at how to deal with GSList/group stuff. (notice: it's
	subject to change)

2003/04/20 rwmcfa1

	* just about every file: added cvs Header: tags

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: missing functions added; version 2.2 functions
	added (some commented out); decorated_window functions added, but
	commented out (how should we go about these?)

2003/04/18 gthyni

	added .cvsignore files for cleaner updates

2003/04/18 muppetman

	* Gnome2/druid.pl: add a button to test out Gnome2::About

	* Gnome2/xs/GnomeAbout.xs: patch from Chas Owens to implement the
	authors and documenters parameter lists, and allow defaults on
	parameters following authors.  (authors is required by gnome_about_new)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs: implemented gtk_accelerator_parse and
	gtk_accelerator_name

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: patch from Chas Owens giving access
	to member widgets

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkImage.xs: implemented new_from_pixbuf and set_from_pixbuf

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs: implemented some stock handling stuff, enough
	to get the stock_browser demo working

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_selection_get_selected

2003/04/18 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: add a header tag and see if i can commit,
	header tags need to be added to everything before to long.


2003/04/17 muppetman

	massive commit of changes made by muppetman and rwmcfa1 since the
	last pre-sourceforge snapshot.

	* G/G.xs, G/gperl.h: added gperl_croak_gerror, takes care of properly
	freeing a GError before croaking with the message it contains

	* G/GObject.xs: don't allow non-RVs in gperl_get_object;
	added G::Object->eq

	* G/gperl.h: added gperl_croak_gerror, takes care of properly freeing
	a GError before croaking with the message it contains

	* Gtk2/gdk.typemap, Gtk2/gtk2perl.h: custom handling for GdkBitmap

	* Gtk2/examples/layout.pl: new example (ported from C by ross)

	* Gtk2/examples/socket.pl, Gtk2/t/0.Gtk2.t, Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t,
	Gtk2/t/2.GtkButton.t, Gtk2/t/3.GtkGammaCurve.t: updates since snapshot

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/textview.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/floppybuddy.gif,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gtk-logo-rgb.gif: another piece of gtk-demo, and
	accessories

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: added lots of missing functionality

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixmap.xs: can now create GdkBitmaps.  warning, GdkBitmap
	may be in the wrong class, there are some complaints at runtime about
	it (porting C code passing a GdkBitmap where a GdkPixmap was wanted,
	i had to re-bless in perl to achieve that).

	* Gtk2/xs/Gtk2.xs: added version information functions

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCurve.xs: work around a C bug that the Gtk+ maintainers
	say won't be fixed (because the widget is to be removed in future
	versions)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHScale.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkHScrollBar.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVScale.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkVScrollBar.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkScrolledWindow.xs: allow default
	parameters

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: place TreeModel at the beginning of ISA so
	Gtk2::TreeModel::get is found before G::Object::get.  remove some
	warn()s.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkNotebook.xs: patch from Emmanuele Bassi, which was a
	double commit, because goran had already fixed it and i didn't
	notice in time

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: implemented insert_with_tags_by_name

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextIter.xs: allow NULL return from get_child_anchor

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextView.xs: oops, bad signature

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented missing new_with_model

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: stack randomly had the wrong number
	of items.  converted to a macro to avoid the use of dXSARGS, and
	suddenly the list_store.pl portion of gtk-demo works.  dXSARGS is
	supposed to work anywhere; i don't understand why it didn't.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented several _modify_* methods

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: allow window type to default to 'toplevel'
	on ->new; all NULL for several other functions' parameters.

	* Gtk2/xs/PangoFont.xs: pango constants.
