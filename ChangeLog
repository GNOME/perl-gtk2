	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: uncommented the freeze/thaw updates functions per
	thierry vignaud's request.

2003/07/08 14:23 muppetman

	* CodeGen.om: massive POD update; use regex to find module name
	instead of relying on people putting whitespace around the '='

2003/07/07 23:10 muppetman

	* CodeGen.pm: slight rework of write_boot.  now you can pass in an
	arbitrary regex for modules to be ignored; the default is still to
	ignore any module that has no :'s in its name.  this fix allows us
	to use write_boot for packages like Gnome::Canvas, which *do* have
	colons in the name of the package that needs to be ignored.
	    also reimplemented the MODULE search to avoid needing grep,
	which is conspicuously absent on most win32 systems.
	    this changes the call signature of write_boot, but all the
	defaults are the same and no module in gtk2-perl-xs was actually
	using anything non-default.  sorry if this breaks you, but it's
	for the best.

2003/07/07 23:03 rwmcfa1

	* t/17.GtkItemFactory.t: added test for item factory

2003/07/06 17:30 muppetman

	* xs/Gtk2.xs: gtk_set_locale().

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version for cvs devel series

2003/07/05 06:06 pcg

        * xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkClipboard.xs: use length() syntax.

        * xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, xs/GtkRc.xs, xs/Gdk.xs, xs/GdkProperty.xs,
        xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs, xs/GtkEditable.xs,
        xs/GtkFontSelection.xs, xs/GtkTextIter.xs: use gchar_own* as
        result type to free the strings and avoid memleaks where no
        CLEANUP existed.

        * xs/GtkTextIter.xs: uncomment get_visible_slice and
        get_visible_text.

        * xs/GtkListItem.xs: fix #endif.

2003/07/04 16:31 muppetman

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: added gdk_get_default_root_window

	* xs/PangoFont.xs: added PANGO_PIXELS

	* Gtk2.pm: bump version for release

2003/06/27 17:01 pcg

	* xs/GdkWindow.xs: gdk_window_set_back_pixmap allows null pixmap.

        * pm/Pango.pm: fix typo.

        * api.pod: small doc changes (basically proofreading for the new
        wrappers model).

2003/06/27 17:00 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: require bleeding edge Glib.

	* gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, gtk-demo/item_factory.pl,
	gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, testgtk.pl: remove bad usage of
	set_data and get_data

	* examples/histogramplot.pl: rewritten with new Glib::Object::Subclass
	features.

2003/06/26 14:49 rwmcfa1

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP: the manifest was updated to include a few
	missing files and a MANIFEST.SKIP file was added to simplify the
	process in the future.

	* Gtk2.pm: cleaned up some of the ItemFactory stuff esp. error messages

	* xs/GtkItemFactor.xs: reworked all of the callback stuff, needs 
	verification

	* examples/item_factory_demo.pl: added, simple exmaple of how to 
	use Gtk2::ItemFactory

2003/06/26 13:48 muppetman

	* pm/Pango.pm: new file allows you to import the Pango constants.

	* Gtk2.pm: allow 'use Gtk2 -init', a la gtk-perl; bumped version
	to 0.25 for CVS.

	* Makefile.PL: add Pango.pm and api.pod to install; install manpages.

	* gtk-demo/images.pl: use normal operators rather than ->eq (works on
	overloaded and persistent wrappers)

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: support for requisitions as writable objects.
	needed for supporting size_request event.

	* xs/GtkStock.xs: watch out for NULLs in stock_item_to_hv; this fixes
	a crash that resulted whenever the stock browser wasn't the first
	thing opened in gtk-demo.

2003/06/26 01:11 pcg

	* META.yml: Add module meta-data in YAML for CPAN.

2003/06/24 08:58 rwmcfa1

	* maps: added GTK_TYPE_LIST and GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM

	* xs/GtkList.xs, xs/GtkListItem.xs: initial import required for use of
	Gtk2::Combo from perl even though they are both deprecated. in the 
	future hopefully this won't be necessary. (also added files to the
	MANIFEST)

2003/06/23 12:07 pcg

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: implement {get,create}_pango_context.

2003/06/22 13:37 pcg

        * gtk-demo/*: fix various minor problems, including using
        binmode for binary streams, and removing misleading "use bytes".

        * xs/GdkPixbufLoader.xs: the right way to access scalars is *not*
        SvPVX, but SvPV. Also removed "count" from ->write, since strings
        in perl are always counted and exposing this c-ism gives no benefit.

        * Makefile.PL: change the glib-not-found error message to the perl
        standard.

        * xs/GdkWindow.xs: enabled various non-deprecated methods I needed
        but weren't implemented yet, plus some rarely used ones.

        * t/01.GtkWindow.t: compare references with == not eq, and
        "$x == undef" is not the right way to tets defined'ness.

2003/06/20 11:33 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, README: bump version for 0.24 release

	* Makefile.PL: just seeing if Glib is available isn't enough, make
	sure it's recent enough, too.  oh, and bump the required glib 
	version while we're at it

2003/06/19 13:46 joered
	* xs/GdkColor.xs: added accessors for GdkColor struct members.

2003/06/19 00:58 pcg

	* Makefile.PL: write a fake Makefile using PREREQ when important
        modules are missing, this ensures auto-installation within CPAN.

2003/06/18 10:48 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: catch undefined values to hush warnings

	* xs/GtkMenu.xs, xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: change stack handling to
	avoid attempting to free undef.

2003/06/17 18:21 muppetman

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GtkObject.xs: push sink functions into Glib, 
	to avoid some problems in which GtkObject created via 
	Glib::Object->new don't have gtk_object_sink called on them.

2003/06/16 22:25 muppetman

	* xs/GdkColor.xs, gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl: not sure how the GBoxed
	change could excite this, but suddenly gdk_color_free is very unhappy
	with the GdkColors created by Gtk2::Gdk::Color->new and ->parse.
	fixed by using gdk_color_copy instead of g_new.  freaky.

2003/06/16 22:21 pcg

        * xs/GtkAdjustment.xs: two minor typoes, found while porting
        gimp-perl to 1.3. Reply to muppetman becomes urgent slowly.

2003/06/16 22:36 joered

	* xs/Gtk2/GtkTextIter.xs: fixed a memory leak. Thanks to
	  muppet for the hint.

2003/06/16 14:31 muppetman

	* xs/GtkStyle.xs, AUTHORS: patch from Tom Hargreaves (hex at freezone 
	dot co dot uk> makes font_desc work correctly.

	* api.pod: nasty typo in example code

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkEvent.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: updated to reflect
	changes in Glib-Perl's GBoxed handling.

2003/06/15 17:03 joered

	* xs/Gtk2/GtkTextIter.xs: added binding for gtk_text_iter_copy

2003/06/12 20:27 muppetman

	* xs/GdkScreen.xs, xs/PangoTabs.xs: newly implemented

2003/06/12 18:06 pcg

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: enable add_events, set/get_extension_events.

2003/06/09 13:49 muppetman

	* xs/GtkClipboard.xs: new stuff; 2.2.x only, so only smoke-tested on
	my end...

2003/06/08 16:40 muppetman

	* api.pod: merged in stuff from the braindump

2003/06/07 18:51 muppetman

	* xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: implemented treemodel->foreach, and some others.

	* xs/GtkTreeView.xs: argument defaults patch from rene seindal 

2003/06/06 23:55 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm, xs/GdkProperty.xs, xs/GdkSelection.xs: added stuff for
	handling GdkAtoms and selections and such.  it appears to have
	some problems, but i don't know if they are binding problems or what.

	* MANIFEST: added several missing files, make dist makes something
	appropriate, now.

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped version number to 0.22 for public release.

2003/06/06 11:39 pcg

        * xs/GtkTextTagTable.xs: new file, all methods of GtkTextTagTable.

2003/06/05 10:53 rwmcfa1

	* t/[0-9]*: prepended 0's onto the front of the 0 - 9 tests to improve
	order. 

2003/06/02 18:10 muppetman

	another patch from marc lehmann:

	* xs/GtkAdjustment.xs: added accessors and mutators for struct members

	* gtk-demo/textview.pl: fix demo to actually use unicode as opposed
	to the garbled latin1.

2003/06/02 12:24 muppetman

	* xs/GtkDialog.xs: allow enum strings as well as integers to
	$dialog->response

	* xs/GdkEvent.xs: remove unused parameters

2003/06/01 22:52 muppetman

	* xs/GtkAspectFrame.xs, GtkTreeSortable.xs: fixed package typos;
	change Gtk2::AspectFrame::set to set_params to avoid clashing with
	Glib::Object::set.  (patch from Marc Lehmann, pcg at goof dot com)

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: patch from rene seindal, remove model from
	return value of get_selected_rows.

2003/05/31 11:07 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkRc.xs: implemented gtk_rc_set_default_files

2003/05/28 14:02 muppetman

	* Makefile.PL: decent diagnostic messages for missing Glib modules

2003/05/27 20:44 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkSelection.xs: gtk 2.2 function
	gtk_selection_owner_set_for_display didn't have the appropriate C_ARGS
	section ommitting the class parameter

2003/05/27 18:50 muppetman

	implementing missing bindings for selection handling and drag and 
	drop stuff.

	* xs/GdkDnd.xs, xs/GtkDnd.xs, xs/GtkSelection.xs, examples/testdnd.pl:
	new files

	* gtk2perl.h, xs/GdkTypes.xs, gdk.typemap: added type handling for
	GdkAtom and GtkTargetEntry

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: added get_colormap

2003/05/27 14:38 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkWidget.xs: get_style was missing, in it's place was style,
	they're aliases of one another now.

2003/05/26 23:58 muppetman

	* xs/GtkMenu.xs: get_attach_widget

2003/05/26 04:05 muppetman

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped version number for development series 0.21

	* xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: wrapped get_selected_rows and
	count_selected_rows for 2.2 and implemented them for 2.0.x;
	get_selected handles scalar context gracefully.

2003/05/26 21:04 rwmcfa1

	* xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: bug fixed at insert_at_cursor. was taking an
	iter for some reason, was otherwise correct.

2003/05/22 10:30 muppetman

	* AUTHORS, LICENSE, *: added copyright and license info to just about
	every file, and pointers to the AUTHORS file which contains the list
	of who's responsible for this mess.

2003/05/18 14:00 muppetman

	* ChangeLog: since breaking the monolithic build into pieces, 
	ChangeLog entries for Gtk2 will be in here.  i've included the 
	contents of the toplevel log up to this point for history.

	* MANIFEST: updated for proper make dist

	* Gtk2.pm: bumped up the version number.

	* Makefile.PL: require Glib >= 0.20

	* README: updated

2003/05/17 09:06 rwmcfa1

	* Glade/*: first pass at GladeXML added

	* Makefile: added, see comments within

	* Makefile.PL: is no more

	* lots and lots of files: G -> Glib and other related/required changes

2003/05/16 14:55 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkSpinButton.xs: removed get_value_as_float because it is
	deprecated (and had the wrong return type anyway).

2003/05/15 11:45 muppetman

	* G/GSignal.xs: hush unused parameter warning, more efficient 
	this way, anyway

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkContainer.xs: implemented foreach

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: minor bugfix

	* G/GType.xs, G/GValue.xs, G/gperl.h, G/typemap,
	Gnome2/xs/GnomeProgram.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCombo.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkFrame.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: use newSVGChar
	and SvGChar instead of newSVpv and SvPV_nolen for gchar*, to ensure
	valid utf8 handling.  this definitely needs testing.

2003/05/06 12:56 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t, Gtk2/t/2.GtkButton.t: prevent windows from
	fighting over focus and thus stall tests (happends with wmaker)

	* Gtk2/t/16.GtkMenu-etc.t: we don't really know how to use 
	tearoff_state so for the time being we won't

2003/05/05 23:11 muppetman

	* G/G.pm, Gtk2/Gtk2.pm: pod updates

2003/05/05 16:35 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: work around a (bug|feature) in the Gtk+
	C library by storing a GtkTooltips reference in the GtkWidget's user
	data.  doesn't hurt normal behavior, and prevents some hard-to-explain
	pitfall errors.

2003/05/03 11:17  joered

	* Gtk2/: Gtk2.pm, Makefile.PL, pm/Helper.pm: removed deprecated
	timeout/idle/input methods from Gtk2.pm; added Gtk2/pm/Helper.pm
	with a convenience implementation of add_watch/remove_watch

2003/05/02 18:11 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/apple-red.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/background.jpg,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-applets.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-calendar.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-foot.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gimp.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gmush.png, Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnome-gsame.png,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gnu-keys.png: images needed by Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl,
	directly from the gtk+-2.2.1 source distribution.

	* G/GType.xs, Gtk2/examples/histogramplot.pl: a bunch of code,
	borrowed from pygtk, to add signals to a derived class.
	altered the histogramplot example to use a new signal.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: allow tip_private to default to NULL

2003/05/02 00:30 muppetman

	* Gtk2/Gtk2.pm, Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/examples/scribble.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl, Gtk2/xs/Gdk.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs:
	reverted the whole GdkRectangle mess.  it's a boxed type again.
	this clears up several bugs to do with GdkAllocation, and in fact
	makes the whole shebang more efficient because we don't just create
	an array any time the GdkRectangle is needed, in which case it is
	often thrown away or only one element is used.  added a ->values
	function, like in gtk2-perl, which returns the members in a list
	in the order you'd want for passing to several important gdk
	functions.  Gtk2::Gdk::Rectangle->new is good for creating new
	rectangles.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextView.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented some
	functions found to be missing when looking for GdkRectangle returns
	that needed to be marked _copy.

2003/05/01 23:17 joered

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCombo.xs: added GtkCombo->entry and GtkCombo->list
	returning the correspondent widgets

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHBox.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVBox.xs: default homogenous is 0
	and default spacing is 5, as in gtk-perl

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: widget flags can now be set with
	Widget->flag_name(1) resp. unset with Widget->flag_name(0);
	Widget->flag_name() still returns current state

2003/05/01 08:00 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStyle.xs: removed deprecated functions, there was a lot 
	of them.

2003/04/31 01:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFrame.xs: properly allow undef in Gtk2::Frame->new (was
	adding an empty string instead of passing NULL)

	* Gtk2/xs/Gdk.xs, Gtk2/xs/GdkPixbufLoader.xs, Gtk2/xs/GdkRegion.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/PangoContext.xs, Gtk2/xs/PangoLayout.xs: newly implemented

	* Gtk2/examples/histogramplot.pl: new code to test drive drawing
	primitives, pango text handling and drawing, and subclassing.  lots
	of stuff in here; was ported from a working C class library i've
	been writing.

	* G/GType.xs, G/GObject.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkObject.xs: support for 
	pure-perl GObject subclasses.
	  added G::Type->register to create a new GType (basically wraps
	g_type_register_static), G::Object->_new, to be called from perl
	constructors for things inheriting GObject, and Gtk2::Object->new,
	which MUST be used for things inheriting GtkObject (to handle the
	floating ref situation properly).
	  this allows the perl developer to create new widgets without writing
	C code!  adding signals and properties is currently not implemented.

	* Gtk2/CodeGen.pm: more correct handling of undef --- previous code 
	was allowing a variable containing undef to pass, which would cause
	a croak in the wrapper-reader function.

	* Gtk2/Gtk2.pm, Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs: stopgap solution, simple lvalue 
	subs to get members from a rectangle list

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl: revert to named member method syntax
	for rectangles

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl: actually works now.  you need the images,
	which i don't think are in CVS yet.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl: cleanup

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixmap.xs: implemented create_from_xpm_d and
	colormap_create_from_xpm_d

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkWindow.xs: allow NULL for cursor in set_cursor

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented create_pango_layout

2003/04/29 21:55 joered

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: bugfix: gtk_list_store_append and
	gtk_list_store_prepend were swapped

2003/04/29 23:44 muppetman

	*  Gtk2/xs/GdkDrawable.xs: implemented gdk_draw_polygon,
	gdk_draw_points, gdk_draw_lines, gdk_draw_segments,
	gdk_draw_layout, and gdk_draw_layout_with_colors

	* G/GObject.xs: removed some very old and very broken commented-out
	code (wrapper instance caching).  added new methods for dealing with
	foreign objects in perl: G::Object->new_from_pointer(VAL, NOINC) (a
	direct wrapper around gperl_new_object), and $object->get_pointer.

2003/04/29 18:10 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: icon list stuff

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/images.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/pixbufs.pl: the last two
	pieces of gtk-demo (need some image files and such, though), and
	these two don't work correctly.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/button_box.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/colorsel.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/dialog.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/editable_cells.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/item_factory.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/list_store.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/main.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/menus.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/panes.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/sizegroup.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/textview.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/tree_store.pl: gtk-demo runs!  lots of cleanup in the
	pieces, and changed each one to us a single entry point name, defined
	in a package with the same name as the file; this bit of subterfuge
	was necessary because of the differences between C and perl, and the
	fact that the app is designed as a C program.  NOTE: drawingarea.pl
	is broken, because my copy has other changes that won't work with
	the current state of CVS.

2003/04/29 16:16 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkGC.xs: impelemted gdk_gc_set_dashes

2003/04/29 15:10 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkSizeGroup.xs: implemented size groups

	* Depends.pm, G/Depends.pm, G/Makefile.PL, Gnome2/Makefile.PL,
	GnomePrint2/Makefile.PL, Gtk2/Makefile.PL, GtkSpell/Makefile.PL,
	G/PkgConfig.pm, Gtk2/CodeGen.pm, helpers/genstuff.pl,
	helpers/genboot.pl: build system hacks.
	moved Depends.pm under G, so that G can install it.
	  made a module of some boilerplate to handle dealing with pkgconfig,
	and converted the code in helpers/genstuff.pl and helpers/genboot.pl
	into Gtk2/CodeGen.pm, stuff that can be called from Makefile.PLs.
	  hacked up a the Makefile.PLs to reflect these changes.
	  this makes it possible to use the autogen build tools outside the 
	source tree --- the first step towards breaking up the source tree 
	into separately distributable modules.

2003/04/29 11:14 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/sizegroup.pl: another little piece of my heart

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs: use alias to ensure that new_with_buttons
	exists for those who seek it.

2003/04/28 23:25 muppetman

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeStore.xs: work around
	bizarre stack behavior by not using a helper function.  trying to
	read the stack in a helper function called from an xsub was resulting
	in the stack showing the wrong number of items.

2003/04/28 18:00 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/panes.pl: another piece of the gtk-demo pie

	* G/G.pm G/GObject.xs: overload the == operator, for more natural
	object comparisons

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkPaned.xs: struct member access

	* Gtk2/Makefile.PL Gtk2/genkeysyms.pl: create a big hash of key
	symbols in Gtk2::Gdk::Keysyms, a la gtk-perl

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckButton.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkImageMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToggleButton.xs: consolidate
	constructors with ALIAS to avoid copying code.  make sure that
	group isn't a valid SV pointing to undef

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented queue_draw, add_accelerator,
	remove_accelerator, and get_display

2003/04/27 08:52- rwmcfa1
	
	* Gtk2/t/16.GtkMenu-etc.t: Added a first pass at the testing of
	GtkMenu and friends.

	* Gtk2/t/15.GtkHandleBox.t: Added a decently complete test of
	GtkHandleBox

	* Gtk2/t/14.GtkToolbar.t: Added a decently complete test of GtkToolbar

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs: Fixed a bug where GtkToolbarChildType was
	wrongly being used as a gtype, caused all _element functions to fail

	* Gtk2/t/13.GtkTooltips.t: Added a decently complete test of
	GtkTooltips

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTooltips.xs: implemented an attempt at
	gtk_tooltips_data_get which returns what is in the GtkTooltipsData
	struct as a hash.

	* Gtk2/t/12.GtkDialog.t: Added a decently complete test of GtkDialog

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkDialog.xs: added gtk_dialog_add_butttons with multiple
	calls to gtk_dialog_add_button. combined the vbox and action_area get
	functions into one aliased function. also changed a char* to a gchar *

	* Gtk2/maps: hand added entry for Gtk2::Progress, removed

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkProgressBar.xs: added a BOOT section with a isa call to
	tell GtkProgressBar that it's a GtkWidget dependant.

2003/04/26 09:53- rwmcfa1

	* GtkSpell/Spell.pm: first pass of documentation

	* GtkSpell/GtkSpell.xs: gtkspell_get_from_text_view now accepts and
	ignores a class

	* Gtk2/t/10.GtkProgressBar.t, Gtk2/t/11.GtkStatusBar.t: first passes
	at testing the two modules

	* Gtk2/maps: hand added a (maybe temporary) entry for Gtk2::Progress

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkProgressBar.xs: removed a bunch of deprecated functions

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkToggleButton.xs: now new with
	string new('string') uses mnemonic instead of label. seems like a good
	idea. you can use new_with_label if you don't want this behavior. also
	impelented news with aliases for new and new_with_mnemonic (saves code
	space/copying).

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckButton.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCheckMenuItem.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkImageMenuItem.xs: same as ^ with the addition of: wrappers
	for _new_with_label were invalid they're now fixed.

2003/04/25 23:01 rwmcfa1

	* GtkSpell/: Initial import of working (for me anyway) GtkSpell
	mappings, give them a try.

2003/04/25 18:17 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/changedisplay.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/drawingarea.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/editable_cells.pl: more demo pieces.  changedisplay.pl
	is completely untested, because i do not have Gtk+ 2.2 on my
	development machine.

	* G/GClosure.xs: always copy SVs that are to be stored.  see the
	perlcall manpage.  this fixes some intermittent bugs that happen
	when reusing the same variable for various objects.

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkWindow.xs: implemented gdk_window_invalidate_rect

	* new-gtk2-perl.html, G/GBoxed.xs, helpers/genstuff.pl, G/gperl.h,
	G/GObject.xs: renamed gperl_register_class to gperl_register_object
	to be more consistent (with gperl_register_fundamental and
	gperl_register_boxed).  also added
	gperl_object_set_no_warn_unreg_subclass, made gperl_get_object
	honor it.

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkGC.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkStyle.xs: set 'no warn for unregistered
	subclasses on GtkStyle and GdkGC.  causes the type system to stop
	spewing messages on stderr about unregistered types from theme
	engines and gdk backends.

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/examples/scribble.pl, Gtk2/xs/GdkEvent.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkCellRenderer.xs: completely reworked
	the handling of GdkRectangle.  it's now treated as a perl list
	instead of an opaque type; this is consistent with gtk-perl and
	makes life easier for manipulating the rectangles in perl.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: changed handling of GtkAllocation, since
	handling of GdkRectangle changed. invisible from the perl side.
	also implemented gtk_widget_get_events.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkImage.xs: implemented gtk_image_new_from_pixmap,
	gtk_image_set_from_pixmap, and gtk_image_get_pixmap

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkLabel.xs: allow Label->new to default to NULL for
	creating empty labels.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: implemented gtk_tree_path_get_indices

2003/04/25 12:40 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t: corrected check for gtk >= 2.2

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t: if 2.2 then try the reorder function

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCurve.xs: re-did set_vector to be clearer and removed a
	unused param name from prototype.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs:  clarified the a for loop's operations
	in get_selections

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeStore.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: added itital pass
	at _store_reorder

	* Gtk2/maps: added stuff new as of gtk2.2.1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkPlug.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs Gtk2/xs/GdkCursor.xs
	Gtk2/xs/GdkDrawable.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkInvisible.xs Gtk2/xs/GtkMenu.xs:
	uncommented stuff new to gtk 2.2 now that maps is up to date for 2.2.1

2003/04/24 18:24 muppetman

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/appwindow.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/button_box.pl,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/colorsel.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/dialog.pl: more pieces of
	the demo

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkToolbar.xs: implemented all the append/prepend/insert
	functions that were left out because they require callbacks

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs: implemented gtk_stock_add

	* G/GSignal.xs, G/gperl.h: export gperl_signal_connect, the actual
	workhorse, so other XSubs can use it

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkColorSelection.xs: fixed get_current_color and
	get_previous_color

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkColorSelectionDialog.xs: member access

	* TODO: high-level things (i forgot to commit this last week)

2003/04/24 17:55 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t: fixed type-o, datam -> data that was
	preventing entries being made into the list

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMessagedialog.xs: removed a TODO, it is probably better
	to just pass the message as you want it rather than use the varargs
	stuff anyway

2003/04/24 13:30 muppetman

	* Gnome2/xs/GnomeProgram.xs, Gnome2/druid.pl: implemented object
	properties on Gnome2::Program->init (was a FIXME)

	* G/GObject.xs: created alias get_property for get and set_property
	for set, since some objects mask the G::Object-level method with
	their own.  in list_properties, don't die if the descr isn't set.

2003/04/24 12:55 muppetman

	* helpers/genstuff.pl: wrap generated code in #ifdefs to support
	versioning (typemaps must be generated even if the code isn't, so
	we generate everything but only use part of it)

2003/04/23 10:44 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHButtonBox.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVButtonBox.xs:
	get_spacing_defaults should accept and ignore class

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h: type-o newSVGdkModiferType -> newSVGdkModifierType

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFontSelection.xs: type functions should not be in XS, it's
	all automagical

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: a first pass at set_icon_list_function added

2003/04/23 10:37 muppetman

	* ChangeLog: new change log, from the cvs log on sourceforge.
	please keep it updated.

2003/04/22 muppetman

	* G/GBoxed.xs: updates to debugging output

	* G/GClosure.xs: don't keep the supplemental arguments array in
	gperl_closure_marshal --- just put mortal values on the stack and
	everything works out fine.  simplifies the code quite a bit, and
	removes some subtle and nasty bugs.

	* G/GType.xs: GPERL_TYPE_SV, a boxed wrapper for perl scalars, mapped
	to the package G::Scalar.  this is handy for storing hashes and other
	perl data structures in a TreeModel.

	* G/GValue.xs: special handling for GPERL_TYPE_SV.  implement handling
	for G_TYPE_INTERFACE.

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/stock_browser.pl, Gtk2/xs/GtkIconFactory.xs: stock
	browser demo and some supporting code

	* Gtk2/gtk2perl.h, Gtk2/xs/GdkTypes.xs: special handling for
	GdkModifierType flags...  GDK_MODIFIER_MASK matches all of the flag
	values, and causes nasty problems when you try to convert the SV flags
	wrapper *back* to C.  so, handle it separately, and don't allow
	GDK_MODIFIER_MASK to make it into perl from C. (can still go the other
	way, though)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: bracket callback with ENTER/SAVETMPS &
	FREETMPS/LEAVE

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkMenu.xs: implemented gtk_menu_popup

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeModel.xs: it's possible for gtk_tree_model_iter_next
	to return NULL

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_view_insert_column_with_data_func

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_view_column_set_cell_data_func

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: default params on set_size_request, and
	implemented render_icon

2003/04/22 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/t/5.GtkListStore-etc.t, Gtk2/t/6.GtkLabel.t,
	Gtk2/t/7.GtkBoxes.t, Gtk2/t/8.GtkCombo.t: initial import

	* Gtk2/t/9.GtkRadioButton.t: test out a little more throughly

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: first pass at
	gtk_file_selection_get_selections, needs to be utf8
	tested/implemented maybe

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs: crash bug, need to make sure that svp
	exists

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioMenuItem.xs: first pass at implementing this class,
	not tested yet

2003/04/21 muppetman

	* G/G.xs, G/gperl.h: added gperl_alloc_temp

	* G/GClosure.xs: added GPerlCallback, and made some robustness fixes
	for GPerlClosure.  (there was bizarre stuff happening in the
	marshaller, wrong number of items in the supplemental arguments
	array.)

	* G/gperl.h: add GPerlCallback, with docs, and some other noise

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/item_factory.pl: gtk-demo driver for GtkItemFactory

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkItemFactory.xs: implemented GtkItemFactory

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: set_flags and unset_flags

2003/04/21 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkRadioButton.xs: implement all of the functions now with a
	first pass at how to deal with GSList/group stuff. (notice: it's
	subject to change)

2003/04/20 rwmcfa1

	* just about every file: added cvs Header: tags

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: missing functions added; version 2.2 functions
	added (some commented out); decorated_window functions added, but
	commented out (how should we go about these?)

2003/04/18 gthyni

	added .cvsignore files for cleaner updates

2003/04/18 muppetman

	* Gnome2/druid.pl: add a button to test out Gnome2::About

	* Gnome2/xs/GnomeAbout.xs: patch from Chas Owens to implement the
	authors and documenters parameter lists, and allow defaults on
	parameters following authors.  (authors is required by gnome_about_new)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkAccelGroup.xs: implemented gtk_accelerator_parse and
	gtk_accelerator_name

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkFileSelection.xs: patch from Chas Owens giving access
	to member widgets

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkImage.xs: implemented new_from_pixbuf and set_from_pixbuf

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkStock.xs: implemented some stock handling stuff, enough
	to get the stock_browser demo working

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeSelection.xs: implemented
	gtk_tree_selection_get_selected

2003/04/18 rwmcfa1

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: add a header tag and see if i can commit,
	header tags need to be added to everything before to long.


2003/04/17 muppetman

	massive commit of changes made by muppetman and rwmcfa1 since the
	last pre-sourceforge snapshot.

	* G/G.xs, G/gperl.h: added gperl_croak_gerror, takes care of properly
	freeing a GError before croaking with the message it contains

	* G/GObject.xs: don't allow non-RVs in gperl_get_object;
	added G::Object->eq

	* G/gperl.h: added gperl_croak_gerror, takes care of properly freeing
	a GError before croaking with the message it contains

	* Gtk2/gdk.typemap, Gtk2/gtk2perl.h: custom handling for GdkBitmap

	* Gtk2/examples/layout.pl: new example (ported from C by ross)

	* Gtk2/examples/socket.pl, Gtk2/t/0.Gtk2.t, Gtk2/t/1.GtkWindow.t,
	Gtk2/t/2.GtkButton.t, Gtk2/t/3.GtkGammaCurve.t: updates since snapshot

	* Gtk2/gtk-demo/textview.pl, Gtk2/gtk-demo/floppybuddy.gif,
	Gtk2/gtk-demo/gtk-logo-rgb.gif: another piece of gtk-demo, and
	accessories

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixbuf.xs: added lots of missing functionality

	* Gtk2/xs/GdkPixmap.xs: can now create GdkBitmaps.  warning, GdkBitmap
	may be in the wrong class, there are some complaints at runtime about
	it (porting C code passing a GdkBitmap where a GdkPixmap was wanted,
	i had to re-bless in perl to achieve that).

	* Gtk2/xs/Gtk2.xs: added version information functions

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkCurve.xs: work around a C bug that the Gtk+ maintainers
	say won't be fixed (because the widget is to be removed in future
	versions)

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkHScale.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkHScrollBar.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkVScale.xs,
	Gtk2/xs/GtkVScrollBar.xs, Gtk2/xs/GtkScrolledWindow.xs: allow default
	parameters

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkListStore.xs: place TreeModel at the beginning of ISA so
	Gtk2::TreeModel::get is found before G::Object::get.  remove some
	warn()s.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkNotebook.xs: patch from Emmanuele Bassi, which was a
	double commit, because goran had already fixed it and i didn't
	notice in time

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextBuffer.xs: implemented insert_with_tags_by_name

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextIter.xs: allow NULL return from get_child_anchor

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTextView.xs: oops, bad signature

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeView.xs: implemented missing new_with_model

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkTreeViewColumn.xs: stack randomly had the wrong number
	of items.  converted to a macro to avoid the use of dXSARGS, and
	suddenly the list_store.pl portion of gtk-demo works.  dXSARGS is
	supposed to work anywhere; i don't understand why it didn't.

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWidget.xs: implemented several _modify_* methods

	* Gtk2/xs/GtkWindow.xs: allow window type to default to 'toplevel'
	on ->new; all NULL for several other functions' parameters.

	* Gtk2/xs/PangoFont.xs: pango constants.
