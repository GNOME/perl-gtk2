* Allow the creation of anonymous marks.  [Marc Lehmann]
* ABI cleanup -- remove private functions from ABI by marking them as static.
  This has the possibility of breaking ABI compatibility; it *shouldn't*,
  because nobody should be using these private functions outside of the Gtk2
  module, but you never know what's going to happen when dealing with win32's
  braindead linker.  If there are any bugs you think are related to this,
  please report them immediately to the gtk-perl-list and we'll fix them
  asap.  [Torsten]
* Newly bound functions and such [Torsten unless otherwise noted]:

    and utf8_to_string_target.
  - Gtk2::Gdk::draw_indexed_image.
  - Gtk2::Pango::Font::get_glyph_extents.
  - Gtk2::Pango::Rectangle and functions that use it,
    Gtk2::Pango::Layout::index_to_pos, get_cursor_pos, get_extents,

  - Gtk2::Pango::LayoutIter and functions that use it,
    Gtk2::Pango::Layout::get_iter, Gtk2::Pango::LayoutIter::get_index,
    at_last_line, next_char, next_cluster, next_run, next_line, 
    get_char_extents, get_cluster_extents, get_run_extents, get_line_extents,
    get_layout_extents, get_line_yrange, and get_baseline.
  - Gtk2::Pango::Fontset.

  - Gtk2::Pango::Context::list_families, Gtk2::Pango::FontFamily::get_name,
    is_monospace, list_faces, Gtk2::Pango::FontFace::describe, get_face_name,
    and list_sizes.  [muppet]
  - Gtk2::Gdk::Input.
  - Gtk2::Gdk::init, init_check, and parse_args.
  - Add and test the ability to change the device with
    Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Motion::device, Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Button::device,
    Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Scroll::device, and Gtk2::Gdk::Event::Proximity::device.

* SimpleList bugfixes; store, pop, shift, unshift, and splice now return the
  proper values.  [Ross]
* Fix incorrect code in examples.  [muppet]
* Doc updates.  [Torsten, Ross]
* Don't overwrite the Gtk2.pm docs with a Gtk2.pod.  Unfortunately, those 
  upgrading from source or CPAN will need to remove the stray Gtk2.pod from
  the perl library manually in order to get the correct docs from perldoc;
  the manpage should upgrade fine.  [Torsten]
* Test suite updates and fixes.  [Torsten, Ross]
* Fix miscellaneous issues.  [Thierry Vignaud, Cory Omand, muppet, Ross]

Overview of Changes in 1.040

    - ExtUtils::PkgConfig >= 1.03  (require only at build time)
  * Add support for new objects and API in gtk+-2.4.0.
  * Derivation of Gtk2::CellRenderer has been reworked; it's much more sane
    now, but we retain backward compatibility with the 1.02x code.
  * It is now possible to implement GInterfaces in Perl code, so you can now
    implement your own Gtk2::TreeModels and Gtk2::CellEditables.  Examples
    are included.
  * The SPLICE operation is now supported on Gtk2::SimpleList's tied data.
  * New, standardized versioning API and documentation.
  * Documentation enhancements all around.
  * Huge test suite expansion and amazing increase in API coverage.

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.038

* Code sweep removed many FIXMEs and fixed lots of problems, and uncovered
  a large handful of missing trivial functions.
* Cleanup on examples.  [Ross]
* New bindings, with tests, for things new in gtk+ in the latest unstable
  release, and for things we found at the last minute while auditing 
  the code  [mostly Torsten]:

  Removed API:
   Gtk2::FileChooser::[gs]et_folder_mode (removed from gtk+ in 2.3.5)
   Gtk2::Allocations have been replaced by Gtk2::Gdk::Rectangles; they
    were just reblessed rectangles anyway.
* Test fixes.  [muppet, Torsten, Ross]
* Random pod updates all over the place.  [muppet]
* Gtk2::CellRenderer now hides "this api is deprecated!" warnings unless env
  var GTK2PERL_DEBUG is set and true.  [muppet]
* Finally fixed Gtk2::Gdk::DragContext::find_window and friends.  [muppet]
* New regression test for custom TreeModel interface implementations.  There
  are several TODO tests that fail, as a reminder to muppet to fix them
  properly.  [Torsten]
* Build GdkX11.xs (and the associated Gtk2::Gdk::X11 namespace) only when
  linking against the x11 gtk+ target.  [muppet]

  deriving containers in Perl code have been punted for the 1.060 API freeze.

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.037
=================================

  New functions: Gtk2->CHECK_VERSION, Gtk2::MAJOR_VERSION, Gtk2::MINOR_VERSION,
  Gtk2::MICRO_VERSION, Gtk2::major_version, Gtk2::minor_version,

  Gtk2::RadioMenuItem::new_with_mnemonic_from_widget
  Gtk2::RadioMenuItem::new_with_label_from_widget

  use that for Gtk2's own error domains.  [muppet]
* Use a weakref rather than object data to keep Tooltips objects alive.
  [muppet, implementing yosh's suggestion]
* Pod fixes and enhancements.  [Ross]

* Even yet still more tests, examples, and bugfixes.
* Improved (corrected?) handling of Gtk2::CellRenderer derivation; based on
  a more generic method for handling vfuncs as inheritable ALL_CAPS methods.
  Includes backward compatibility, plenty of documentation, and updated
  examples.  [muppet]
* Allow perl implementations of the Gtk2::CellEditable and Gtk2::TreeModel
  interfaces; two new examples included.  Huge thanks to Bjarne Steinsbo.

* x/y event members are now available where they should be, GdkEvent doc 
  improved. corrected some invalid function -> package mappings.
* missing/TODO functions implemented in GdkDrawable
* Bug fix related to colormaps fixed in GdkGC 

Overview of Changes in Gtk2 1.031
=================================

* Updated Glib requirement to 1.031.
* Added binding support for objects and functions new in gtk+-2.3.x.  Not
  all tests are complete.  Updated gtk-demo and examples to use the new stuff
  if available.  This code will be protected by 2.4.0 version guards when
  gtk+-2.4.0 is finally released.  Note: The unstable-2-3-x-branch in CVS
  is now dead.  [muppet]
* New example in gtk-demo (ported from C) shows how to make hyperlinks in
  a TextView. [muppet, from gtk+]
* Converted all of the Gtk2::Gdk::Event accessors into combination accessors
  and mutators. [Ross]
* Provide a fallback implementation of Gtk2::Gdk::Event::new when linking
  against gtk+-2.0.x, so we can always create events (needed for synthesizing
  events in tests). [muppet]
* Even yet still more tests. [Torsten]
* Don't copy colors when accessing Style members; this makes it possible to
  change the colors in a style. [Torsten]
* Various little bugfixes, memory leak plugs, ornulls, doc updates, build
  enhancements, etc.

Overview of Changes from Gtk2 1.02x to 1.030
============================================

* All of the fixes on the 1.02x branch have been made here as well, including
  the 64-bit cleanliness stuff, the MessageDialog utf8 fix, and the SimpleList
  base issue that broke upgrades from really old gtk2-perl.
* Torsten has competely redone the test suite, more than doubling its size.
  Exhaustive is a good word.  Added Gtk2::TestHelper, which automates
  several tedious jobs for testing things based on Gtk2.
* Lots of general clean up.  Many small bugfixes (add ornull here, fix a broken
  call signature there, fix uninitialized variables all over the place, etc).
  Adjust ALIASed xsubs to remove invalid methods from the perl namespace.
  Never allow NULL to be passed to SvOK().
* New examples: how to use Perl threads and Gtk2 together safely; how to
  colorize rows in a SimpleList; how to add your own stock items; how to use
  inline XPM images.
* Add support for GdkRegions.  Improved support for GtkRcStyles.
* Added lots of other esoteric functions.  Our api coverage is creeping up.
* Move the implementation of the ItemFactory stuff from Perl to XS, and in
  the process fixed the bug that kept accelerators from showing up properly.
* Extended handling of GdkGeometry.  In addition to the method accessors,
  you can create the geom as a hash; the bindings will calculate the valid
  mask for you.
* Implement custom marshaller for the rows-reordered signal, making it
  usable.  (Patch from Roderich Schupp)
* Completed the implementation of SPLICE on SimpleList's TiedList class.
