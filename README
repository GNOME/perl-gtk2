Gtk2
====

Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user interface library.
This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and
object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.  Find out more about Gtk+
at http://www.gtk.org.

The GTK+ Reference Manual [ http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gtk/ ]
is also a handy companion when writing Gtk programs in any language.
The Perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and the C reference
should be considered the canonical documentation.

Be sure to check out the example programs in the "examples" and "gtk-demo"
directories.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


To avoid installing to a system directory, since this is a beta release,
you can change the installation prefix at Makefile.PL time with

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/some/other/place

This will install the module to the subdirectory lib/perl5 under the given
prefix.  If this is not already in perl's include path, you'll need to tell
perl how to get to this library directory so you can use it; there are three
ways:

  in your environment (the easiest):
    # assuming a bourne-style shell
    PERL5LIB=/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl
    export PERL5LIB

  on the perl command line:
    perl -I /some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl yourscript

  in the code of your perl script:
    use lib '/some/other/place/lib/perl5/site_perl';
